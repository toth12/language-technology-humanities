The\nMercians after this became Christians.  From the beginning of the\nworld had now elapsed five thousand eight hundred and fifty\nwinters, when Peada, the son of Penda, assumed the government of\nthe Mercians.  In his time came together himself and Oswy,\nbrother of King Oswald, and said, that they would rear a minster\nto the glory of Christ, and the honour of St. Peter.  And they\ndid so, and gave it the name of Medhamsted; because there is a\nwell there, called Meadswell.  And they began the groundwall, and\nwrought thereon; after which they committed the work to a monk,\nwhose name was Saxulf.  He was very much the friend of God, and\nhim also loved all people.  He was nobly born in the world, and\nrich: he is now much richer with Christ.  But King Peada reigned\nno while; for he was betrayed by his own queen, in Easter-tide.\nThis year Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, consecrated Deus-dedit to\nCanterbury, on the twenty-sixth day of March.", "A.D. 656.  This year was Peada slain; and Wulfhere, son of Penda,\nsucceeded to the kingdom of the Mercians.  In his time waxed the\nabbey of Medhamsted very rich, which his brother had begun.  The\nking loved it much, for the love of his brother Peada, and for\nthe love of his wed-brother Oswy, and for the love of Saxulf the\nabbot.  He said, therefore, that he would dignify and honour it\nby the counsel of his brothers, Ethelred and Merwal; and by the\ncounsel of his sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha; and by the\ncounsel of the archbishop, who was called Deus-dedit; and by the\ncounsel of all his peers, learned and lewd, that in his kingdom\nwere.  And he so did.  Then sent the king after the abbot, that\nhe should immediately come to him.  And he so did.  Then said the\nking to the abbot: \"Beloved Saxulf, I have sent after thee for\nthe good of my soul; and I will plainly tell thee for why.  My\nbrother Peada and my beloved friend Oswy began a minster, for the\nlove of Christ and St. Peter: but my brother, as Christ willed,\nis departed from this life; I will therefore intreat thee,\nbeloved friend, that they earnestly proceed on their work; and I\nwill find thee thereto gold and silver, land and possessions, and\nall that thereto behoveth.\"  Then went the abbot home, and began\nto work.  So he sped, as Christ permitted him; so that in a few\nyears was that minster ready.  Then, when the king heard say\nthat, he was very glad; and bade men send through all the nation,\nafter all his thanes; after the archbishop, and after bishops:\nand after his earls; and after all those that loved God; that\nthey should come to him.  And he fixed the day when men should\nhallow the minster.  And when they were hallowing the minster,\nthere was the king, Wulfere, and his brother Ethelred, and his\nsisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha.  And the minster was hallowed\nby Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury; and the Bishop of\nRochester, Ithamar; and the Bishop of London, who was called\nWina; and the Bishop of the Mercians, whose name was Jeruman; and\nBishop Tuda.  And there was Wilfrid, priest, that after was\nbishop; and there were all his thanes that were in his kingdom.\nWhen the minster was hallowed, in the name of St. Peter, and St.\nPaul, and St. Andrew, then stood up the king before all his\nthanes, and said with a loud voice: \"Thanks be to the high\nalmighty God for this worship that here is done; and I will this\nday glorify Christ and St. Peter, and I will that you all confirm\nmy words.--I Wulfere give to-day to St. Peter, and the Abbot\nSaxulf, and the monks of the minster, these lands, and these\nwaters, and meres, and fens, and weirs, and all the lands that\nthereabout lye, that are of my kingdom, freely, so that no man\nhave there any ingress, but the abbot and the monks.  This is the\ngift.  From Medhamsted to Northborough; and so to the place that\nis called Foleys; and so all the fen, right to Ashdike; and from\nAshdike to the place called Fethermouth; and so in a right line\nten miles long to Ugdike; and so to Ragwell; and from Ragwell\nfive miles to the main river that goeth to Elm and to Wisbeach;\nand so about three miles to Trokenholt; and from Trokenholt right\nthrough all the fen to Derworth; that is twenty miles long; and\nso to Great Cross; and from Great Cross through a clear water\ncalled Bradney; and thence six miles to Paxlade; and so forth\nthrough all the meres and fens that lye toward Huntingdon-port;\nand the meres and lakes Shelfermere and Wittlesey mere, and all\nthe others that thereabout lye; with land and with houses that\nare on the east side of Shelfermere; thence all the fens to\nMedhamsted; from Medhamsted all to Welmsford; from Welmsford to\nClive; thence to Easton; from Easton to Stamford; from Stamford\nas the water runneth to the aforesaid Northborough.\"--These are\nthe lands and the fens that the king gave unto St. Peter's\nminster.--Then quoth the king: \"It is little--this gift--\nbut I will that they hold it so royally and so freely, that there\nbe taken there from neither gild nor gable, but for the monks\nalone.  Thus I will free this minster; that it be not subject\nexcept to Rome alone; and hither I will that we seek St. Peter,\nall that to Rome cannot go.\"  During these words the abbot\ndesired that he would gant him his request.  And the king granted\nit.  \"I have here (said he) some good monks that would lead their\nlife in retirement, if they wist where.  Now here is an island,\nthat is called Ankerig; and I will request, that we may there\nbuild a minster to the honour of St. Mary; that they may dwell\nthere who will lead their lives in peace and tranquillity.\"  Then\nanswered the king, and quoth thus: \"Beloved Saxulf, not that only\nwhich thou desirest, but all things that I know thou desirest in\nour Lord's behalf, so I approve, and grant.  And I bid thee,\nbrother Ethelred, and my sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, for\nthe release of your souls, that you be witnesses, and that you\nsubscribe it with your fingers.  And I pray all that come after\nme, be they my sons, be they my brethren, or kings that come\nafter me, that our gift may stand; as they would be partakers of\nthe life everlasting, and as they would avoid everlasting\npunishment.  Whoso lesseneth our gift, or the gift of other good\nmen, may the heavenly porter lessen him in the kingdom of heaven;\nand whoso advanceth it, may the heavenly porter advance him in\nthe kingdom of heaven.\"  These are the witnesses that were there,\nand that subscribed it with their fingers on the cross of Christ,\nand confirmed it with their tongues.  That was, first the king,\nWulfere, who confirmed it first with his word, and afterwards\nwrote with his finger on the cross of Christ, saying thus: \"I\nWulfere, king, in the presence of kings, and of earls, and of\ncaptains, and of thanes, the witnesses of my gift, before the\nArchbishop Deus-dedit, I confirm it with the cross of Christ.\"\n(+)--\"And I Oswy, king of the Northumbrians, the friend of this\nminster, and o[oe] the Abbot Saxulf, commend it with the cross of\nChrist.\" (+)--\"And I Sighere, king, ratify it with the cross of\nChrist.\" (+)--\"And I Sibbi, king, subscribe it with the cross\nof Christ.\" (+)--\"And I Ethelred, the king's brother, granted\nthe same with the cross of Christ.\" (+)--\"And we, the king's\nsisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, approve it.\"--\"And I\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Deus-dedit, ratify it.\"--Then\nconfirmed it all the others that were there with the cross of\nChrist (+): namely, Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester; Wina, Bishop of\nLondon; Jeruman, Bishop of the Mercians; and Tuda, bishop; and\nWilfrid, priest, who was afterwards bishop; and Eoppa, priest,\nwhom the king, Wulfere, sent to preach christianity in the Isle\nof Wight; and Saxulf, abbot; and Immine, alderman, and Edbert,\nalderman, and Herefrith, alderman, and Wilbert, alderman, and\nAbo, alderman; Ethelbald, Brord, Wilbert, Elmund, Frethegis.\nThese, and many others that were there, the king's most loyal\nsubjects, confirmed it all.  This charter was written after our\nLord's Nativity 664--the seventh year of King Wulfere--the\nninth year of Archbishop Deus-dedir.  Then they laid God's curse,\nand the curse of all saints, and all christian folks, on\nwhosoever undid anything that there was done.  \"So be it,\" saith\nall.  \"Amen.\"--When this thing was done, then sent the king to\nRome to the Pope Vitalianus that then was, and desired, that he\nwould ratify with his writ and with his blessing, all this\naforesaid thing.  And the pope then sent his writ, thus saying:\n\"I Vitalianus, pope, grant thee, King Wulfere, and Deus-dedit,\narchbishop, and Abbot Saxulf, all the things that you desire.\nAnd I forbid, that any king, or any man, have any ingress, but\nthe abbot alone; nor shall he be Subject to any man, except the\nPope of Rome and the Archbishop of Canterbury.  If any one\nbreaketh anything of this, St. Peter with his sword destroy him.\nWhosoever holdeth it, St. Peter with heaven's key undo him the\nkingdom of heaven.\"--Thus was the minster of Medhamsted begun,\nthat was afterwards called Peter-borough.  Afterwards came\nanother archbishop to Canterbury, who was called Theodorus; a\nvery good man and wise; and held his synod with his bishops and\nwith his clerk.  There was Wilfrid, bishop of the Mercians,\ndeprived of his bishopric; and Saxulf, abbot, was there chosen\nbishop; and Cuthbald, monk of the same minster, was chosen abbot.\nThis synod was holden after our Lord's Nativity six hundred and\nseventy-three winters.", "A.D. 658.

Arnulf, his\nbrother's son, had six weeks before his death bereft him of his\nkingdom; which was now divided into five portions, and five kings\nwere consecrated thereto.  This, however, was done with the\nconsent of Arnulf; and they agreed that they should hold in\nsubjection to him; because none of them had by birth any claim on\nthe father's side, except him alone.  Arnulf, therefore, dwelt in\nthe country eastward of the Rhine; Rodulf took to the middle\ndistrict; Oda to the western; whilst Berenger and Witha became\nmasters of Lombardy and the Cisalpine territory.  But they held\ntheir dominion in great discord; fought two general battles, and\nfrequently overran the country in partial encounters, displacing\neach other several times.  The same year also, in which the\nDanish army advanced beyond the bridge at Paris, Alderman\nEthelhelm led the alms of the West-Saxons and of King Alfred to\nRome.", "A.D. 888.  This year Alderman Beeke conducted the alms of the\nWest-Saxons and of King Alfred to Rome; but Queen Ethelswith, who\nwas the sister of King Alfred, died on the way to Rome; and her\nbody lies at Pavia.  The same year also Ethered, Archbishop of\nCanterbury and Alderman Ethelwold, died in one month.", "A.D. 889.  This year there was no journey to Rome; except that\nKing Alfred sent two messengers with letters.", "A.D. 890.  This year Abbot Bernhelm conducted the alms of the\nWest-Saxons and of King Alfred to Rome; and Guthrum, king of the\nNorthern men, departed this life, whose baptismal name was\nAthelstan.  He was the godson of King Alfred; and he abode among\nthe East-Angles, where he first established a settlement.  The\nsame year also went the army from the Seine to Saint Lo, which is\nbetween the Bretons and the Franks; where the Bretons fought with\nthem, obtained the victory, and drove them out into a river, in\nwhich many of them were drowned.  This year also was Plegmund\nchosen by God and all his saints to the archbishopric in\nCanterbury.", "A.D. 891.  This year went the army eastward; and King Arnulf\nfought with the land-force, ere the ships arrived, in conjunction\nwith the eastern Franks, and Saxons, and Bavarians, and put them\nto flight.  And three Scots came to King Alfred in a boat without\nany oars from Ireland; whence they stole away, because they would\nlive in a state of pilgrimage, for the love of God, they recked\nnot where.  The boat in which they came was made of two hides and\na half; and they took with them provisions for seven nights; and\nwithin seven nights they came to land in Cornwall, and soon after\nwent to King Alfred.  They were thus named: Dubslane, and\nMacbeth, and Maelinmun.  And Swinney, the best teacher that was\namong the Scots, departed this life.  And the same year after\nEaster, about the gang-days or before, appeared the star that men\nin book-Latin call \"cometa\": some men say that in English it may\nbe termed \"hairy star\"; for that there standeth off from it a\nlong gleam of light, whilom on one side, whilom on each.", "A.D. 893.  This year went the large army, that we before spoke\nabout, back from the eastern district westward to Bologne; and\nthere were shipped; so that they transported themselves over at\none time with their horses withal.  And they came up with two\nhundred and fifty ships into the mouth of the Limne, which is in\nEast-Kent, at the east end of the vast wood that we call Andred.\nThis wood is in length, east and west, one hundred and twenty\nmiles, or longer, and thirty miles broad.  The river that we\nbefore spoke about lieth out of the weald.  On this river they\ntowed up their ships as far as the weald, four miles from the\nmouth outwards; and there destroyed a fort within the fen,\nwhereon sat a few churls, and which was hastily wrought.  Soon\nafter this came Hasten up with eighty ships into the mouth of the\nThames, and wrought him there a work at Milton, and the other\narmy at Appledore.", "A.D. 894.  This year, that was about twelve months after they had\nwrought a work in the eastern district, the Northumbrians and\nEast-Angles had given oaths to King Alfred, and the East-Angles\nsix hostages; nevertheless, contrary to the truce, as oft as the\nother plunderers went out with all their army, then went they\nalso, either with them, or in a separate division.  Upon this\nKing Alfred gathered his army, and advanced, so that he encamped\nbetween the two armies at the highest point he could find\ndefended by wood and by water, that he might reach either, if\nthey would seek any field.  Then went they forth in quest of the\nwealds, in troops and companies, wheresoever the country was\ndefenceless.  But they were also sought after most days by other\ncompanies, either by day or by night, both from the army and also\nfrom the towns.  The king had divided his army into two parts; so\nthat they were always half at home, half out; besides the men\nthat should maintain the towns.  The army came not all out of\ntheir stations more than twice; once, when they first came to\nland, ere the forces were collected, and again, when they wished\nto depart from their stations.  They had now seized much booty,\nand would ferry it northward over Thames into Essex, to meet\ntheir ships.  But the army rode before them, fought with them at\nFarnham, routed their forces, and there arrested the booty.  And\nthey flew over Thames without any ford, then up by the Colne on\nan island.  Then the king's forces beset them without as long as\nthey had food; but they had their time set, and their meat noted.\nAnd the king was advancing thitherwards on his march with the\ndivision that accompanied him.  But while he was advancing\nthitherwards, the other force was returning homewards.  The\nDanes, however, still remained behind; for their king was wounded\nin the fight, so that they could not carry him.  Then collected\ntogether those that dwell in Northumbria and East-Anglia about a\nhundred ships, and went south about; and with some forty more\nwent north about, and besieged a fort in Devonshire by the north\nsea; and those who went south about beset Exeter.  When the king\nheard that, then went he west towards Exeter with all his force,\nexcept a very considerable part of the eastern army, who advanced\ntill they came to London; and there being joined by the citizens\nand the reinforcements that came from the west, they went east to\nBarnfleet.  Hasten was there with his gang, who before were\nstationed at Milton, and also the main army had come thither,\nthat sat before in the mouth of the Limne at Appledore.  Hasten\nhad formerly constructed that work at Barnfleet, and was then\ngone out on plunder, the main army being at home.  Then came the\nking's troops, and routed the enemy, broke down the work, took\nall that was therein money, women, and children and brought all\nto London.  And all the ships they either broke to pieces, or\nburned, or brought to London or to Rochester.  And Hasten's wife\nand her two sons they brought to the king, who returned them to\nhim, because one of them was his godson, and the other Alderman\nEthered's.  They had adopted them ere Hasten came to Bamfleet;\nwhen he had given them hostages and oaths, and the king had also\ngiven him many presents; as he did also then, when he returned\nthe child and the wife.  And as soon as they came to Bamfleet,\nand the work was built, then plundered he in the same quarter of\nhis kingdom that Ethered his compeer should have held; and at\nanother time he was plundering in the same district when his work\nwas destroyed.  The king then went westward with the army toward\nExeter, as I before said, and the army had beset the city; but\nwhilst he was gone they went to their ships.  Whilst he was thus\nbusied there with the army, in the west, the marauding parties\nwere both gathered together at Shobury in Essex, and there built\na fortress.  Then they both went together up by the Thames, and a\ngreat concourse joined them, both from the East-Angles and from\nthe Northumbrians.  They then advanced upward by the Thames, till\nthey arrived near the Severn.  Then they proceeded upward by the\nSevern.  Meanwhile assembled Alderman Ethered, Alderman Ethelm,\nAlderman Ethelnoth, and the king's thanes, who were employed at\nhome at the works, from every town east of the Parret, as well as\nwest of Selwood, and from the parts east and also north of the\nThames and west of the Severn, and also some part of North-Wales.\nWhen they were all collected together, they overtook the rear of\nthe enemy at Buttington on the banks of the Severn, and there\nbeset them without on each side in a fortress.  When they had sat\nthere many weeks on both sides of the water, and the king\nmeanwhile was in Devonshire westward with the naval force, then\nwere the enemy weighed down with famine.  They had devoured the\ngreater part of their horses; and the rest had perished with\nhunger.  Then went they out to the men that sat on the eastern\nside of the river, and fought with them; but the Christians had\nthe victory.  And there Ordhelm, the king's thane, was slain; and\nalso many other king's thanes; and of the Danes there were many\nslain, and that part of them that came away escaped only by\nflight.  As soon as they came into Essex to their fortress, and\nto their ships, then gathered the remnant again in East-Anglia\nand from the Northumbrians a great force before winter, and\nhaving committed their wives and their ships and their booty to\nthe East-Angles, they marched on the stretch by day and night,\ntill they arrived at a western city in Wirheal that is called\nChester.  There the army could not overtake them ere they arrived\nwithin the work: they beset the work though, without, some two\ndays, took all the cattle that was thereabout, slew the men whom\nthey could overtake without the work, and all the corn they\neither burned or consumed with their horses every evening.  That\nwas about a twelvemonth since they first came hither over sea.", "A.D. 895.  Soon after that, in this year, went the army from\nWirheal into North-Wales; for they could not remain there,\nbecause they were stripped both of the cattle and the corn that\nthey had acquired by plunder.  When they went again out of\nNorth-Wales with the booty they had acquired there, they marched over\nNorthumberland and East-Anglia, so that the king's army could not\nreach them till they came into Essex eastward, on an island that\nis out at sea, called Mersey.  And as the army returned homeward\nthat had beset Exeter, they went up plundering in Sussex nigh\nChichester; but the townsmen put them to flight, and slew many\nhundreds of them, and took some of their ships.  Then, in the\nsame year, before winter, the Danes, who abode in Mersey, towed\ntheir ships up on the Thames, and thence up the Lea.  That was\nabout two years after that they came hither over sea.", "A.D. 896.  This same year wrought the aforesaid army a work by\nthe Lea, twenty miles above the city of London.   Then, in the\nsummer of this year, went a large party of the citizens, and also\nof other folk, and made an attack on the work of the Danes; but\nthey were there routed, and some four of the king's thanes were\nslain.  In the harvest afterward the king encamped close to the\ncity, whilst they reaped their corn, that the Danes might not\ndeprive them of the crop.  Then, some day, rode the king up by\nthe river; and observed a place where the river might be\nobstructed, so that they could not bring out their ships.  And\nthey did so.  They wrought two works on the two sides of the\nriver.  And when they had begun the work, and encamped before it,\nthen understood the army that they could not bring out their\nships.  Whereupon they left them, and went over land, till they\ncame to Quatbridge by Severn; and there wrought a work.  Then\nrode the king's army westward after the enemy.  And the men of\nLondon fetched the ships; and all that they could not lead away\nthey broke up; but all that were worthy of capture they brought\ninto the port of London.  And the Danes procured an asylum for\ntheir wives among the East-Angles, ere they went out of the fort.\nDuring the winter they abode at Quatbridge.  That was about three\nyears since they came hither over sea into the mouth of the\nLimne.", "A.D. 897.  In the summer of this year went the army, some into\nEast-Anglia, and some into Northumbria; and those that were\npenniless got themselves ships, and went south over sea to the\nSeine.  The enemy had not, thank God, entirely destroyed the\nEnglish nation; but they were much more weakened in these three\nyears by the disease of cattle, and most of all of men; so that\nmany of the mightiest of the king's thanes, that were in the\nland, died within the three years.  Of these, one was Swithulf\nBishop of Rochester, Ceolmund alderman in Kent, Bertulf alderman\nin Essex, Wulfred alderman in Hampshire, Elhard Bishop of\nDorchester, Eadulf a king's thane in Sussex, Bernuff governor of\nWinchester, and Egulf the king's horse-thane; and many also with\nthem; though I have named only the men of the highest rank.  This\nsame year the plunderers in East-Anglia and Northumbria greatly\nharassed the land of the West-Saxons by piracies on the southern\ncoast, but most of all by the esks which they built many years\nbefore.  Then King Alfred gave orders for building long ships\nagainst the esks, which were full-nigh twice as long as the\nothers.  Some had sixty oars, some more; and they were both\nswifter and steadier, and also higher than the others.  They were\nnot shaped either after the Frisian or the Danish model, but so\nas he himself thought that they might be most serviceable.  Then,\nat a certain turn of this same year, came six of their ships to\nthe Isle of Wight; and going into Devonshire, they did much\nmischief both there and everywhere on the seacoast.  Then\ncommanded the king his men to go out against them with nine of\nthe new ships, and prevent their escape by the mouth of the river\nto the outer sea.  Then came they out against them with three\nships, and three others were standing upwards above the mouth on\ndry land: for the men were gone off upon shore.  Of the first\nthree ships they took two at the mouth outwards, and slew the\nmen; the third veered off, but all the men were slain except\nfive; and they too were severely wounded.  Then came onward those\nwho manned the other ships, which were also very uneasily\nsituated.  Three were stationed on that side of the deep where\nthe Danish ships were aground, whilst the others were all on the\nopposite side; so that none of them could join the rest; for the\nwater had ebbed many furlongs from them.  Then went the Danes\nfrom their three ships to those other three that were on their\nside, be-ebbed; and there they then fought.  There were slain\nLucomon, the king's reve, and Wulfheard, a Frieslander; Ebb, a\nFrieslander, and Ethelere, a Frieslander; and Ethelferth, the\nking's neat-herd; and of all the men, Frieslanders and English,\nsixty-two; of the Danes a hundred and twenty.  The tide, however,\nreached the Danish ships ere the Christians could shove theirs\nout; whereupon they rowed them out; but they were so crippled,\nthat they could not row them beyond the coast of Sussex: there\ntwo of them the sea drove ashore; and the crew were led to\nWinchester to the king, who ordered them to be hanged.  The men\nwho escaped in the single ship came to East-Anglia, severely\nwounded.  This same year were lost no less than twenty ships, and\nthe men withal, on the southern coast.  Wulfric, the king's\nhorse-thane, who was also viceroy of Wales, died the same year.", "A.D. 898.  This year died Ethelm, alderman of Wiltshire, nine\nnights before midsummer; and Heahstan, who was Bishop of London.", "A.D. 901.  This year died ALFRED, the son of Ethelwulf, six\nnights before the mass of All Saints.  He was king over all the\nEnglish nation, except that part that was under the power of the\nDanes.  He held the government one year and a half less than\nthirty winters; and then Edward his son took to the government.\nThen Prince Ethelwald, the son of his paternal uncle, rode\nagainst the towns of Winburn and of Twineham, without leave of\nthe king and his council.  Then rode the king with his army; so\nthat he encamped the same night at Badbury near Winburn; and\nEthelwald remained within the town with the men that were under\nhim, and had all the gates shut upon him, saying, that he would\neither there live or there die.  But in the meantime he stole\naway in the night, and sought the army in Northumberland.  The\nking gave orders to ride after him; but they were not able to\novertake him.  The Danes, however, received him as their king.\nThey then rode after the wife that Ethelwald had taken without\nthe king's leave, and against the command of the bishops; for she\nwas formerly consecrated a nun.  In this year also died Ethered,\nwho was alderman of Devonshire, four weeks before King Alfred.", "A.D. 902.  This year was the great fight at the Holme (39)\nbetween the men of Kent and the Danes.", "((A.D. 902.  This year Elswitha died.))", "A.D. 903.  This year died Alderman Ethelwulf, the brother of\nElhswitha, mother of King Edward; and Virgilius abbot of the\nScots; and Grimbald the mass-priest; on the eighth day of July.\nThis same year was consecrated the new minster at Winchester, on\nSt. Judoc's advent.", "A.D. 904.  This year came Ethelwald hither over sea with all the\nfleet that he could get, and he was submitted to in Essex. This\nyear the moon was eclipsed.", "A.D. 905.  This year Ethelwald enticed the army in East-Anglia to\nrebellion; so that they overran all the land of Mercia, until\nthey came to Cricklade, where they forded the Thames; and having\nseized, either in Bradon or thereabout, all that they could lay\ntheir hands upon, they went homeward again.  King Edward went\nafter, as soon as he could gather his army, and overran all their\nland between the foss and the Ouse quite to the fens northward.\nThen being desirous of returning thence, he issued an order\nthrough the whole army, that they should all go out at once.  But\nthe Kentish men remained behind, contrary to his order, though he\nhad sent seven messengers to them.  Whereupon the army surrounded\nthem, and there they fought.  There fell Aldermen Siwulf and\nSigelm; Eadwold, the king's thane; Abbot Kenwulf; Sigebriht, the\nson of Siwulf; Eadwald, the son of Acca; and many also with them;\nthough I have named the most considerable.  On the Danish side\nwere slain Eohric their king, and Prince Ethelwald, who had\nenticed them to the war.  Byrtsige, the son of Prince Brihtnoth;\nGovernor Ysop; Governor Oskytel; and very many also with them\nthat we now cannot name.  And there was on either hand much\nslaughter made; but of the Danes there were more slain, though\nthey remained masters of the field.  Ealswitha died this same\nyear; and a comet appeared on the thirteenth day before the\ncalends of November.", "((A.D. 906.  This year King Edward, from necessity, concluded a\npeace both with the army of East-Anglia and of North-humbria.))", "A.D. 907.  This year died Alfred, who was governor of Bath.  The\nsame year was concluded the peace at Hitchingford, as King Edward\ndecreed, both with the Danes of East-Anglia, and those of\nNorthumberland; and Chester was rebuilt.", "A.D. 909.  This year died Denulf, who was Bishop of Winchester;\nand the body of St. Oswald was translated from Bardney into\nMercia.", "A.D. 910.  This year Frithestan took to the bishopric of\nWinchester; and Asser died soon after, who was Bishop of\nSherborne.  The same year King Edward sent an army both from\nWessex and Mercia, which very much harassed the northern army by\ntheir attacks on men and property of every kind.  They slew many\nof the Danes, and remained in the country five weeks.  This year\nthe Angles and the Danes fought at Tootenhall; and the Angles had\nthe victory.  The same year Ethelfleda built the fortress at\nBramsbury.", "((A.D. 910.  This year the army of the Angles and of the Danes\nfought at Tootenhall.  And Ethelred, ealdor of the Mercians,\ndied; and King Edward took possession of London, and of Oxford,\nand of all the lands which owed obedience thereto.  And a great\nfleet came hither from the south, from the Lidwiccas (Brittany),\nand greatly ravaged by the Severn; but they were, afterwards,\nalmost all perished.))", "A.D. 911.  This year the army in Northumberland broke the truce,\nand despised every right that Edward and his son demanded of\nthem; and plundered the land of the Mercians.  The king had\ngathered together about a hundred ships, and was then in Kent\nwhile the ships were sailing along sea by the south-east to meet\nhim.  The army therefore supposed that the greatest part of his\nforce was in the ships, and that they might go, without being\nattacked, where that ever they would.  When the king learned on\nenquiry that they were gone out on plunder, he sent his army both\nfrom Wessex and Mercia; and they came up with the rear of the\nenemy as he was on his way homeward, and there fought with him\nand put him to flight, and slew many thousands of his men.  There\nfell King Eowils, and King Healfden; Earls Ohter and Scurf;\nGovernors Agmund, Othulf, and Benesing; Anlaf the Swarthy, and\nGovernor Thunferth; Osferth the collector, and Governor\nGuthferth.", "((A.D. 911.  Then the next year after this died Ethelred, lord of\nthe Mercians.))", "A.D. 912.  This year died Ethered, alderman of Mercia; and King\nEdward took to London, and to Oxford, and to all the lands that\nthereunto belonged.  This year also came Ethelfleda, lady of the\nMercians, on the holy eve called the invention of the holy cross,\nto Shergate, and built the fortress there, and the same year that\nat Bridgenorth.", "A.D. 913.  This year, about Martinmas, King Edward had the\nnorthern fortress built at Hertford, betwixt the Memer, and the\nBenwic, and the Lea.  After this, in the summer, betwixt gang-days\nand midsummer, went King Edward with some of his force into\nEssex, to Maldon; and encamped there the while that men built and\nfortified the town of Witham.  And many of the people submitted\nto him, who were before under the power of the Danes.  And some\nof his force, meanwhile, built the fortress at Hertford on the\nsouth side of the Lea.  This year by the permission of God went\nEthelfleda, lady of Mercia, with all the Mercians to Tamworth;\nand built the fort there in the fore-part of the summer; and\nbefore Lammas that at Stafford: in the next year that at\nEddesbury, in the beginning of the summer; and the same year,\nlate in the autumn, that at Warwick.  Then in the following year\nwas built, after mid-winter, that at Chirbury and that at\nWarburton; and the same year before mid-winter that at Runkorn.", "((A.D. 915.  This year was Warwick built.))", "A.D. 916.  This year was the innocent Abbot Egbert slain, before\nmidsummer, on the sixteenth day before the calends of July.  The\nsame day was the feast of St. Ciricius the martyr, with his\ncompanions. And within three nights sent Ethelfleda an army into\nWales, and stormed Brecknock; and there took the king's wife,\nwith some four and thirty others.", "A.D. 917.  This year rode the army, after Easter, out of\nNorthampton and Leicester; and having broken the truce they slew\nmany men at Hookerton and thereabout.  Then, very soon after\nthis, as the others came home, they found other troops that were\nriding out against Leighton.  But the inhabitants were aware of\nit; and having fought with them they put them into full flight;\nand arrested all that they had taken, and also of their horses\nand of their weapons a good deal.", "A.D. 918.  This year came a great naval armament over hither\nsouth from the Lidwiccians; (40) and two earls with it, Ohter and\nRhoald.  They went then west about, till they entered the mouth\nof the Severn; and plundered in North-Wales everywhere by the\nsea, where it then suited them; and took Camlac the bishop in\nArchenfield, and led him with them to their ships; whom King\nEdward afterwards released for forty pounds.  After this went the\narmy all up; and would proceed yet on plunder against\nArchenfield; but the men of Hertford met them, and of Glocester,\nand of the nighest towns; and fought with them, and put them to\nflight; and they slew the Earl Rhoald, and the brother of Ohter\nthe other earl, and many of the army.  And they drove them into a\npark; and beset them there without, until they gave them\nhostages, that they would depart from the realm of King Edward.\nAnd the king had contrived that a guard should be set against\nthem on the south side of Severnmouth; west from Wales, eastward\nto the mouth of the Avon; so that they durst nowhere seek that\nland on that side.  Nevertheless, they eluded them at night, by\nstealing up twice; at one time to the east of Watchet, and at\nanother time at Porlock.  There was a great slaughter each time;\nso that few of them came away, except those only who swam out to\nthe ships.  Then sat they outward on an island, called the\nFlat-holms; till they were very short of meat, and many men died of\nhunger, because they could not reach any meat.  Thence went they\nto Dimmet, and then out to Ireland.  This was in harvest.  After\nthis, in the same year, before Martinmas, went King Edward to\nBuckingham with his army, and sat there four weeks, during which\nhe built the two forts on either side of the water, ere he\ndeparted thence. And Earl Thurkytel sought him for his lord; and\nall the captains, and almost all the first men that belonged to\nBedford; and also many of those that belonged to Northampton.\nThis year Ethelfleda, lady of the Mercians, with the help of God,\nbefore Laminas, conquered the town called Derby, with all that\nthereto belonged; and there were also slain four of her thanes,\nthat were most dear to her, within the gates.", "((A.D. 918.  But very shortly after they had become so, she died\nat Tamworth, twelve days before midsummer, the eighth year of her\nhaving rule and right lordship over the Mercians; and her body\nlies at Gloucester, within the east porch of St. Peter's\nchurch.))", "A.D. 919.  This year King Edward went with his army to Bedford,\nbefore Martinmas, and conquered the town; and almost all the\nburgesses, who obeyed him before, returned to him; and he sat\nthere four weeks, and ordered the town to be repaired on the\nsouth side of the water, ere he departed thence.", "((A.D. 919.  This year also the daughter of Ethelred, lord of the\nMercians, was deprived of all dominion over the Mercians, and\ncarried into Wessex, three weeks before mid-winter; she was\ncalled Elfwina.))", "A.D. 920.  This year, before midsummer, went King Edward to\nMaldon; and repaired and fortified the town, ere he departed\nthence.  And the same year went Earl Thurkytel over sea to\nFrankland with the men who would adhere to him, under the\nprotection and assistance of King Edward.  This year Ethelfleda\ngot into her power, with God's assistance, in the early part of\nthe year, without loss, the town of Leicester; and the greater\npart of the army that belonged thereto submitted to her.  And the\nYorkists had also promised and confirmed, some by agreement and\nsome with oaths, that they would be in her interest.  But very\nsoon after they had done this, she departed, twelve nights before\nmidsummer, at Tamworth, the eighth year that she was holding the\ngovernment of the Mercians with right dominion; and her body\nlieth at Glocester, in the east porch of St. Peter's church.\nThis year also was the daughter of Ethered, lord of the Mercians,\ndeprived of all authority over the Mercians, and led into Wessex,\nthree weeks before midwinter.  Her name was Healfwina.", "A.D. 921.  This year, before Easter, King Edward ordered his men\nto go to the town of Towcester, and to rebuild it.  Then again,\nafter that, in the same year, during the gang-days, he ordered\nthe town of Wigmore to be repaired.  The same summer, betwixt\nLammas and midsummer, the army broke their parole from\nNorthampton and from Leicester; and went thence northward to\nTowcester, and fought against the town all day, and thought that\nthey should break into it; but the people that were therein\ndefended it, till more aid came to them; and the enemy then\nabandoned the town, and went away.  Then again, very soon after\nthis, they went out at night for plunder, and came upon men\nunaware, and seized not a little, both in men and cattle, betwixt\nBurnham-wood and Aylesbury.  At the same time went the army from\nHuntington and East-Anglia, and constructed that work at\nTernsford; which they inhabited and fortified; and abandoned the\nother at Huntingdon; and thought that they should thence oft with\nwar and contention recover a good deal of this land.  Thence they\nadvanced till they came to Bedford; where the men who were within\ncame out against them, and fought with them, and put them to\nflight, and slew a good number of them.  Then again, after this,\na great army yet collected itself from East-Anglia and from\nMercia, and went to the town of Wigmore; which they besieged\nwithout, and fought against long in the day; and took the cattle\nabout it; but the men defended the town, who were within; and the\nenemy left the town, and went away.  After this, the same summer,\na large force collected itself in King Edward's dominions, from\nthe nighest towns that could go thither, and went to Temsford;\nand they beset the town, and fought thereon; until they broke\ninto it, and slew the king, and Earl Toglos, and Earl Mann his\nson, and his brother, and all them that were therein, and who\nwere resolved to defend it; and they took the others, and all\nthat was therein.  After this, a great force collected soon in\nharvest, from Kent, from Surrey, from Essex, and everywhere from\nthe nighest towns; and went to Colchester, and beset the town,\nand fought thereon till they took it, and slew all the people,\nand seized all that was therein; except those men who escaped\ntherefrom over the wall.  After this again, this same harvest, a\ngreat army collected itself from East-Anglia, both of the\nland-forces and of the pirates, which they had enticed to their\nassistance, and thought that they should wreak their vengeance.\nThey went to Maldon, and beset the town, and fought thereon,\nuntil more aid came to the townsmen from without to help.  The\nenemy then abandoned the town, and went from it.  And the men\nwent after, out of the town, and also those that came from\nwithout to their aid; and put the army to flight, and slew many\nhundreds of them, both of the pirates and of the others.  Soon\nafter this, the same harvest, went King Edward with the\nWest-Saxon army to Passham; and sat there the while that men\nfortified the town of Towcester with a stone wall.  And there\nreturned to him Earl Thurferth, and the captains, and all the\narmy that belonged to Northampton northward to the Welland, and\nsought him for their lord and protector.  When this division of\nthe army went home, then went another out, and marched to the\ntown of Huntingdon; and repaired and renewed it, where it was\nbroken down before, by command of King Edward.  And all the\npeople of the country that were left submitted to King Edward,\nand sought his peace and protection.  After this, the same year,\nbefore Martinmas, went King Edward with the West-Saxon army to\nColchester; and repaired and renewed the town, where it was\nbroken down before.  And much people turned to him, both in\nEast-Anglia and in Essex, that were before under the power of the\nDanes.  And all the army in East-Anglia swore union with him;\nthat they would all that he would, and would protect all that he\nprotected, either by sea or land.  And the army that belonged to\nCambridge chose him separately for their lord and protector, and\nconfirmed the same with oaths, as he had advised.  This year King\nEdward repaired the town of Gladmouth; and the same year King\nSihtric slew Neil his brother.", "A.D. 922.  This year, betwixt gang-days and midsummer, went King\nEdward with his army to Stamford, and ordered the town to be\nfortified on the south side of the river.  And all the people\nthat belonged to the northern town submitted to him, and sought\nhim for their lord.  It was whilst he was tarrying there, that\nEthelfleda his sister died at Tamworth, twelve nights before\nmidsummer.  Then rode he to the borough of Tamworth; and all the\npopulation in Mercia turned to him, who before were subject to\nEthelfleda. And the kings in North-Wales, Howel, and Cledauc,\nand Jothwel, and all the people of North-Wales, sought him for\ntheir lord.  Then went he thence to Nottingham, and secured that\nborough, and ordered it to be repaired, and manned both with\nEnglish and with Danes.  And all the population turned to him,\nthat was settled in Mercia, both Danish and English.", "A.D. 923.  This year went King Edward with an army, late in the\nharvest, to Thelwall; and ordered the borough to be repaired, and\ninhabited, and manned.

This year, before midsummer, went King Edward with an\narmy to Nottingham; and ordered the town to be repaired on the\nsouth side of the river, opposite the other, and the bridge over\nthe Trent betwixt the two towns.  Thence he went to Bakewell in\nPeakland; and ordered a fort to be built as near as possible to\nit, and manned.  And the King of Scotland, with all his people,\nchose him as father and lord; as did Reynold, and the son of\nEadulf, and all that dwell in Northumbria, both English and\nDanish, both Northmen and others; also the king of the\nStrathclydwallians, and all his people.", "((A.D. 924.

On the second year after he was consecrated, he\nmade many minsters; and drove out the clerks (43) from the\nbishopric, because they would hold no rule, and set monks\ntherein.  He made there two abbacies; one of monks, another of\nnuns.  That was all within Winchester.  Then came he afterwards\nto King Edgar, and requested that he would give him all the\nminsters that heathen men had before destroyed; for that he would\nrenew them.  This the king cheerfully granted; and the bishop\ncame then first to Ely, where St. Etheldritha lies, and ordered\nthe minster to be repaired; which he gave to a monk of his, whose\nname was Britnoth, whom he consecrated abbot: and there he set\nmonks to serve God, where formerly were nuns.  He then bought\nmany villages of the king, and made it very rich.  Afterwards\ncame Bishop Athelwold to the minster called Medhamsted, which was\nformerly ruined by heathen folk; but he found there nothing but\nold walls, and wild woods.  In the old walls at length he found\nhid writings which Abbot Hedda had formerly written;--how King\nWulfhere and Ethelred his brother had wrought it, and how they\nfreed it against king and against bishop, and against all worldly\nservice; and how Pope Agatho confirmed it with his writ, as also\nArchbishop Deusdedit.  He then ordered the minster to be rebuilt;\nand set there an abbot, who was called Aldulf; and made monks,\nwhere before was nothing.  He then came to the king, and let him\nlook at the writings which before were found; and the king then\nanswered and said: \"I Edgar grant and give to-day, before God and\nbefore Archbishop Dunstan, freedom to St. Peter's minster at\nMedhamsted, from king and from bishop; and all the thorps that\nthereto lie; that is, Eastfield, and Dodthorp, and Eye, and\nPaston.

This year came the army about again into the Thames,\nand went up thence along the Medway to Rochester; where the\nKentish army came against them, and encountered them in a close\nengagement; but, alas!  they too soon yielded and fled; because\nthey had not the aid that they should have had.  The Danes\ntherefore occupied the field of battle, and, taking horse, they\nrode as wide as they would, spoiling and overrunning nearly all\nWest-Kent.  Then the king with his council determined to proceed\nagainst them with sea and land forces; but as soon as the ships\nwere ready, then arose delay from day to day, which harassed the\nmiserable crew that lay on board; so that, always, the forwarder\nit should have been, the later it was, from one time to another;--they\nstill suffered the army of their enemies to increase;--the\nDanes continually retreated from the sea-coast;--and they\ncontinually pursued them in vain.  Thus in the end these\nexpeditions both by sea and land served no other purpose but to\nvex the people, to waste their treasure, and to strengthen their\nenemies.\"", "A.D. 1000.  This year the king went into Cumberland, and nearly\nlaid waste the whole of it with his army, whilst his navy sailed\nabout Chester with the design of co-operating with his land-forces;\nbut, finding it impracticable, they ravaged Anglesey.\nThe hostile fleet was this summer turned towards the kingdom of\nRichard.", "A.D. 1001.  This year there was great commotion in England in\nconsequence of an invasion by the Danes, who spread terror and\ndevastation wheresoever they went, plundering and burning and\ndesolating the country with such rapidity, that they advanced in\none march as far as the town of Alton; where the people of\nHampshire came against them, and fought with them.  There was\nslain Ethelwerd, high-steward of the king, and Leofric of\nWhitchurch, and Leofwin, high-steward of the king, and Wulfhere,\na bishop's thane, and Godwin of Worthy, son of Bishop Elfsy; and\nof all the men who were engaged with them eighty-one.  Of the\nDanes there was slain a much greater number, though they remained\nin possession of the field of battle.  Thence they proceeded\nwestward, until they came into Devonshire; where Paley came to\nmeet them with the ships which he was able to collect; for he had\nshaken off his allegiance to King Ethelred, against all the vows\nof truth and fidelity which he had given him, as well as the\npresents which the king had bestowed on him in houses and gold\nand silver.  And they burned Teignton, and also many other goodly\ntowns that we cannot name; and then peace was there concluded\nwith them.  And they proceeded thence towards Exmouth, so that\nthey marched at once till they came to Pin-hoo; where Cole,\nhigh-steward of the king, and Edsy, reve of the king, came against\nthem with the army that they could collect.  But they were there\nput to flight, and there were many slain, and the Danes had\npossession of the field of battle.  And the next morning they\nburned the village of Pin-hoo, and of Clist, and also many goodly\ntowns that we cannot name.  Then they returned eastward again,\ntill they came to the Isle of Wight.  The next morning they\nburned the town of Waltham, and many other small towns; soon\nafter which the people treated with them, and they made peace.", "((A.D. 1001.  This year the army came to Exmouth, and then went\nup to the town, and there continued fighting stoutly; but they\nwere very strenuously resisted.  Then went they through the land,\nand did all as was their wont; destroyed and burnt.  Then was\ncollected a vast force of the people of Devon and of the people\nof Somerset, and they then came together at Pen.  And so soon as\nthey joined battle, then the people gave way: and there they made\ngreat slaughter, and then they rode over the land, and their last\nincursion was ever worse than the one before: and then they\nbrought much booty with them to their ships.  And thence they\nwent into the Isle of Wight, and there they roved about, even as\nthey themselves would, and nothing withstood them: nor any fleet\nby sea durst meet them; nor land force either, went they ever so\nfar up.  Then was it in every wise a heavy time, because they\nnever ceased from their evil doings.))", "A.D. 1002.  This year the king and his council agreed that\ntribute should be given to the fleet, and peace made with them,\nwith the provision that they should desist from their mischief.\nThen sent the king to the fleet Alderman Leofsy, who at the\nking's word and his council made peace with them, on condition\nthat they received food and tribute; which they accepted, and a\ntribute was paid of 24,000 pounds.  In the meantime Alderman\nLeofsy slew Eafy, high-steward of the king; and the king banished\nhim from the land.  Then, in the same Lent, came the Lady Elfgive\nEmma, Richard's daughter, to this land.  And in the same summer\ndied Archbishop Eadulf; and also, in the same year the king gave\nan order to slay all the Danes that were in England.  This was\naccordingly done on the mass-day of St. Brice; because it was\ntold the king, that they would beshrew him of his life, and\nafterwards all his council, and then have his kingdom without any\nresistance.", "A.D. 1003.  This year was Exeter demolished, through the French\nchurl Hugh, whom the lady had appointed her steward there.  And\nthe army destroyed the town withal, and took there much spoil.\nIn the same year came the army up into Wiltshire.  Then was\ncollected a very great force, from Wiltshire and from Hampshire;\nwhich was soon ready on their march against the enemy: and\nAlderman Elfric should have led them on; but he brought forth his\nold tricks, and as soon as they were so near, that either army\nlooked on the other, then he pretended sickness, and began to\nretch, saying he was sick; and so betrayed the people that he\nshould have led: as it is said, \"When the leader is sick the\nwhole army is hindered.\"  When Sweyne saw that they were not\nready, and that they all retreated, then led he his army into\nWilton; and they plundered and burned the town.  Then went he to\nSarum; and thence back to the sea, where he knew his ships were.", "A.D. 1004.  This year came Sweyne with his fleet to Norwich,\nplundering and burning the whole town.  Then Ulfkytel agreed with\nthe council in East-Anglia, that it were better to purchase peace\nwith the enemy, ere they did too much harm on the land; for that\nthey had come unawares, and he had not had time to gather his\nforce.  Then, under the truce that should have been between them,\nstole the army up from their ships, and bent their course to\nThetford.  When Ulfkytel understood that, then sent he an order\nto hew the ships in pieces; but they frustrated his design.  Then\nhe gathered his forces, as secretly as he could.  The enemy came\nto Thetford within three weeks after they had plundered Norwich;\nand, remaining there one night, they spoiled and burned the town;\nbut, in the morning, as they were proceeding to their ships, came\nUlfkytel with his army, and said that they must there come to\nclose quarters.  And, accordingly, the two armies met together;\nand much slaughter was made on both sides.  There were many of\nthe veterans of the East-Angles slain; but, if the main army had\nbeen there, the enemy had never returned to their ships.  As they\nsaid themselves, that they never met with worse hand-play in\nEngland than Ulfkytel brought them.", "A.D. 1005.  This year died Archbishop Elfric; and Bishop Elfeah\nsucceeded him in the archbishopric.  This year was the great\nfamine in England so severe that no man ere remembered such.  The\nfleet this year went from this land to Denmark, and took but a\nshort respite, before they came again.", "A.D. 1006.  This year Elfeah was consecrated Archbishop; Bishop\nBritwald succeeded to the see of Wiltshire; Wulfgeat was deprived\nof all his property; (51) Wulfeah and Ufgeat were deprived of\nsight; Alderman Elfelm was slain; and Bishop Kenulf (52) departed\nthis life.  Then, over midsummer, came the Danish fleet to\nSandwich, and did as they were wont; they barrowed and burned and\nslew as they went.  Then the king ordered out all the population\nfrom Wessex and from Mercia; and they lay out all the harvest\nunder arms against the enemy; but it availed nothing more than it\nhad often done before.  For all this the enemy went wheresoever\nthey would; and the expedition did the people more harm than\neither any internal or external force could do.  When winter\napproached, then went the army home; and the enemy retired after\nMartinmas to their quarters in the Isle of Wight, and provided\nthemselves everywhere there with what they wanted.  Then, about\nmidwinter, they went to their ready farm, throughout Hampshire\ninto Berkshire, to Reading.  And they did according to their\ncustom,--they lighted their camp-beacons as they advanced.\nThence they marched to Wallingford, which they entirely\ndestroyed, and passed one night at Cholsey.  They then turned\nalong Ashdown to Cuckamsley-hill, and there awaited better cheer;\nfor it was often said, that if they sought Cuckamsley, they would\nnever get to the sea.  But they went another way homeward.  Then\nwas their army collected at Kennet; and they came to battle\nthere, and soon put the English force to flight; and afterwards\ncarried their spoil to the sea.  There might the people of\nWinchester see the rank and iniquitous foe, as they passed by\ntheir gates to the sea, fetching their meat and plunder over an\nextent of fifty miles from sea.  Then was the king gone over the\nThames into Shropshire; and there he fixed his abode during\nmidwinter.  Meanwhile, so great was the fear of the enemy, that\nno man could think or devise how to drive them from the land, or\nhold this territory against them; for they had terribly marked\neach shire in Wessex with fire and devastation.  Then the king\nbegan to consult seriously with his council, what they all\nthought most advisable for defending this land, ere it was\nutterly undone.  Then advised the king and his council for the\nadvantage of all the nation, though they were all loth to do it,\nthat they needs must bribe the enemy with a tribute.  The king\nthen sent to the army, and ordered it to be made known to them,\nthat his desire was, that there should be peace between them, and\nthat tribute and provision should be given them.  And they\naccepted the terms; and they were provisioned throughout England.", "((A.D. 1006.  This year Elphege was consecrated archbishop [of\nCanterbury].))", "A.D. 1007.  In this year was the tribute paid to the hostile\narmy; that was, 30,000 pounds.  In this year also was Edric\nappointed alderman over all the kingdom of the Mercians.  This\nyear went Bishop Elfeah to Rome after his pall.", "A.D. 1008.  This year bade the king that men should speedily\nbuild ships over all England; that is, a man possessed of three\nhundred and ten hides to provide on galley or skiff; and a man\npossessed of eight hides only, to find a helmet and breastplate\n(53).", "A.D. 1009.  This year were the ships ready, that we before spoke\nabout; and there were so many of them as never were in England\nbefore, in any king's days, as books tell us.  And they were all\ntransported together to Sandwich; that they should lie there, and\ndefend this land against any out-force.  But we have not yet had\nthe prosperity and the honour, that the naval armament should be\nuseful to this land, any more than it often before was.  It was\nat this same time, or a little earlier, that Brihtric, brother of\nAlderman Edric, bewrayed Wulnoth, the South-Saxon knight, father\nof Earl Godwin, to the king; and he went into exile, and enticed\nthe navy, till he had with him twenty ships; with which he\nplundered everywhere by the south coast, and wrought every kind\nof mischief.  When it was told the navy that they might easily\nseize him, if they would look about them, then took Brihtric with\nhim eighty ships; and thought that he should acquire for himself\nmuch reputation, by getting Wulnoth into his hands alive or dead.\nBut, whilst they were proceeding thitherward, there came such a\nwind against them, as no man remembered before; which beat and\ntossed the ships, and drove them aground; whereupon Wulnoth soon\ncame, and burned them.  When this was known to the remaining\nships, where the king was, how the others fared, it was then as\nif all were lost.  The king went home, with the aldermen and the\nnobility; and thus lightly did they forsake the ships; whilst the\nmen that were in them rowed them back to London.  Thus lightly\ndid they suffer the labour of all the people to be in vain; nor\nwas the terror lessened, as all England hoped.  When this naval\nexpedition was thus ended, then came, soon after Lammas, the\nformidable army of the enemy, called Thurkill's army, to\nSandwich; and soon they bent their march to Canterbury; which\ncity they would quickly have stormed, had they not rather desired\npeace; and all the men of East-Kent made peace with the army, and\ngave them 3,000 pounds for security.  The army soon after that\nwent about till they came to the Isle of Wight; and everywhere in\nSussex, and in Hampshire, and also in Berkshire, they plundered\nand burned, as THEIR CUSTOM IS. (54)  Then ordered the king to\nsummon out all the population, that men might hold firm against\nthem on every side; but nevertheless they marched as they\npleased.  On one occasion the king had begun his march before\nthem, as they proceeded to their ships, and all the people were\nready to fall upon them; but the plan was then frustrated through\nAlderman Edric, AS IT EVER IS STILL.  Then after Martinmas they\nwent back again to Kent, and chose their winter-quarters on the\nThames; obtaining their provisions from Essex, and from the\nshires that were next, on both sides of the Thames.  And oft they\nfought against the city of London; but glory be to God, that it\nyet standeth firm: and they ever there met with ill fare.  Then\nafter midwinter took they an excursion up through Chiltern, (55)\nand so to Oxford; which city they burned, and plundered on both\nsides of the Thames to their ships.  Being fore-warned that there\nwas an army gathered against them at London, they went over at\nStaines; and thus were they in motion all the winter, and in\nspring, appeared again in Kent, and repaired their ships.", "A.D. 1010.  This year came the aforesaid army, after Easter, into\nEast Anglia; and went up at Ipswich, marching continually till\nthey came where they understood Ulfcytel was with his army.  This\nwas on the day called the first of the Ascension of our Lord.\nThe East-Angles soon fled.  Cambridgeshire stood firm against\nthem.  There was slain Athelstan, the king's relative, and Oswy,\nand his son, and Wulfric, son of Leofwin, and Edwy, brother of\nEfy, and many other good thanes, and a multitude of the people.\nThurkytel Myrehead first began the flight; and the Danes remained\nmasters of the field of slaughter.  There were they horsed; and\nafterwards took possession of East-Anglia, where they plundered\nand burned three months; and then proceeded further into the wild\nfens, slaying both men and cattle, and burning throughout the\nfens.  Thetford also they burned, and Cambridge; and afterwards\nwent back southward into the Thames; and the horsemen rode\ntowards the ships.  Then went they west-ward into Oxfordshire,\nand thence to Buckinghamshire, and so along the Ouse till they\ncame to Bedford, and so forth to Temsford, always burning as they\nwent.  Then returned they to their ships with their spoil, which\nthey apportioned to the ships.  When the king's army should have\ngone out to meet them as they went up, then went they home; and\nwhen they were in the east, then was the army detained in the\nwest; and when they were in the south, then was the army in the\nnorth.  Then all the privy council were summoned before the king,\nto consult how they might defend this country.  But, whatever was\nadvised, it stood not a month; and at length there was not a\nchief that would collect an army, but each fled as he could: no\nshire, moreover, would stand by another.  Before the feast-day of\nSt. Andrew came the enemy to Northampton, and soon burned the\ntown, and took as much spoil thereabout as they would; and then\nreturned over the Thames into Wessex, and so by Cannings-marsh,\nburning all the way.  When they had gone as far as they would,\nthen came they by midwinter to their ships.", "A.D. 1011.  This year sent the king and his council to the army,\nand desired peace; promising them both tribute and provisions, on\ncondition that they ceased from plunder.  They had now overrun\nEast-Anglia [1], and Essex [2], and Middlesex [3], and\nOxfordshire [4], and Cambridgeshire [5], and Hertfordshire [6],\nand Buckinghamshire [7], and Bedfordshire [8], and half of\nHuntingdonshire [9], and much of Northamptonshire [10]; and, to\nthe south of the Thames, all Kent, and Sussex, and Hastings, and\nSurrey, and Berkshire, and Hampshire, and much of Wiltshire.  All\nthese disasters befel us through bad counsels; that they would\nnot offer tribute in time, or fight with them; but, when they had\ndone most mischief, then entered they into peace and amity with\nthem.  And not the less for all this peace, and amity, and\ntribute, they went everywhere in troops; plundering, and\nspoiling, and slaying our miserable people.  In this year,\nbetween the Nativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas, they beset\nCanterbury, and entered therein through treachery; for Elfmar\ndelivered the city to them, whose life Archbishop Elfeah formerly\nsaved.  And there they seized Archbishop Elfeah, and Elfward the\nking's steward, and Abbess Leofruna, (56) and Bishop Godwin; and\nAbbot Elfmar they suffered to go away.  And they took therein all\nthe men, and husbands, and wives; and it was impossible for any\nman to say how many they were; and in the city they continued\nafterwards as long as they would.  And, when they had surveyed\nall the city, they then returned to their ships, and led the\narchbishop with them.\n          Then was a captive\n          he who before was\n          of England head\n          and Christendom;--\n          there might be seen", "          great wretchedness,\n          where oft before\n          great bliss was seen,\n          in the fated city,\n          whence first to us\n          came Christendom,\n          and bliss 'fore God\n          and 'fore the world.\nAnd the archbishop they kept with them until the time when they\nmartyred him.", "A.D. 1012.  This year came Alderman Edric, and all the oldest\ncounsellors of England, clerk and laity, to London before Easter,\nwhich was then on the ides of April; and there they abode, over\nEaster, until all the tribute was paid, which was 48,000 pounds.\nThen on the Saturday was the army much stirred against the\nbishop; because he would not promise them any fee, and forbade\nthat any man should give anything for him.  They were also much\ndrunken; for there was wine brought them from the south.  Then\ntook they the bishop, and led him to their hustings, on the eve\nof the Sunday after Easter, which was the thirteenth before the\ncalends of May; and there they then shamefully killed him.  They\noverwhelmed him with bones and horns of oxen; and one of them\nsmote him with an axe-iron on the head; so that he sunk downwards\nwith the blow; and his holy blood fell on the earth, whilst his\nsacred soul was sent to the realm of God.  The corpse in the\nmorning was carried to London; and the bishops, Ednoth and\nElfhun, and the citizens, received him with all honour, and\nburied him in St. Paul's minster; where God now showeth this holy\nmartyr's miracles.  When the tribute was paid, and the peace-oaths\nwere sworn, then dispersed the army as widely as it was\nbefore collected.  Then submitted to the king five and forty of\nthe ships of the enemy; and promised him, that they would defend\nthis land, and he should feed and clothe them.", "A.D. 1013.  The year after that Archbishop Elfeah was martyred,\nthe king appointed Lifing to the archiepiscopal see of\nCanterbury.  And in the same year, before the month August, came\nKing Sweyne with his fleet to Sandwich; and very soon went about\nEast-Anglia into the Humber-mouth, and so upward along the Trent,\nuntil he came to Gainsborough.  Then soon submitted to him Earl\nUtred, and all the Northumbrians, and all the people of Lindsey,\nand afterwards the people of the Five Boroughs, and soon after\nall the army to the north of Watling-street; and hostages were\ngiven him from each shire.  When he understood that all the\npeople were subject to him, then ordered he that his army should\nhave provision and horses; and he then went southward with his\nmain army, committing his ships and the hostages to his son\nKnute.  And after he came over Watling-street, they wrought the\ngreatest mischief that any army could do.  Then he went to\nOxford; and the population soon submitted, and gave hostages;\nthence to Winchester, where they did the same.  Thence went they\neastward to London; and many of the party sunk in the Thames,\nbecause they kept not to any bridge.  When he came to the city,\nthe population would not submit; but held their ground in full\nfight against him, because therein was King Ethelred, and\nThurkill with him.  Then went King Sweyne thence to Wallingford;\nand so over Thames westward to Bath, where he abode with his\narmy.  Thither came Alderman Ethelmar, and all the western thanes\nwith him, and all submitted to Sweyne, and gave hostages.  When\nhe had thus settled all, then went he northward to his ships; and\nall the population fully received him, and considered him full\nking.  The population of London also after this submitted to him,\nand gave hostages; because they dreaded that he would undo them.\nThen bade Sweyne full tribute and forage for his army during the\nwinter; and Thurkill bade the same for the army that lay at\nGreenwich: besides this, they plundered as oft as they would.\nAnd when this nation could neither resist in the south nor in the\nnorth, King Ethelred abode some while with the fleet that lay in\nthe Thames; and the lady (57) went afterwards over sea to her\nbrother Richard, accompanied by Elfsy, Abbot of Peterborough.\nThe king sent Bishop Elfun with the ethelings, Edward and Alfred,\nover sea; that he might instruct them.  Then went the king from\nthe fleet, about midwinter, to the Isle of Wight; and there abode\nfor the season; after which he went over sea to Richard, with\nwhom he abode till the time when Sweyne died.  Whilst the lady\nwas with her brother beyond sea, Elfsy, Abbot of Peterborough,\nwho was there with her, went to the abbey called Boneval, where\nSt. Florentine's body lay; and there found a miserable place, a\nmiserable abbot, and miserable monks: because they had been\nplundered.  There he bought of the abbot, and of the monks, the\nbody of St. Florentine, all but the head, for 500 pounds; which,\non his return home, he offered to Christ and St. Peter.", "A.D. 1014.  This year King Sweyne ended his days at Candlemas,\nthe third day before the nones of February; and the same year\nElfwy, Bishop of York, was consecrated in London, on the festival\nof St. Juliana.  The fleet all chose Knute for king; whereupon\nadvised all the counsellors of England, clergy and laity, that\nthey should send after King Ethelred; saying, that no sovereign\nwas dearer to them than their natural lord, if he would govern\nthem better than he did before.  Then sent the king hither his\nson Edward, with his messengers; who had orders to greet all his\npeople, saying that he would be their faithful lord--would\nbetter each of those things that they disliked--and that each\nof the things should be forgiven which had been either done or\nsaid against him; provided they all unanimously, without\ntreachery, turned to him.  Then was full friendship established,\nin word and in deed and in compact, on either side.  And every\nDanish king they proclaimed an outlaw for ever from England.\nThen came King Ethelred home, in Lent, to his own people; and he\nwas gladly received by them all.  Meanwhile, after the death of\nSweyne, sat Knute with his army in Gainsborough until Easter; and\nit was agreed between him and the people of Lindsey, that they\nshould supply him with horses, and afterwards go out all together\nand plunder.  But King Ethelred with his full force came to\nLindsey before they were ready; and they plundered and burned,\nand slew all the men that they could reach.  Knute, the son of\nSweyne, went out with his fleet (so were the wretched people\ndeluded by him), and proceeded southward until he came to\nSandwich.  There he landed the hostages that were given to his\nfather, and cut off their hands and ears and their noses.\nBesides all these evils, the king ordered a tribute to the army\nthat lay at Greenwich, of 21,000 pounds.  This year, on the eve\nof St. Michael's day, came the great sea-flood, which spread wide\nover this land, and ran so far up as it never did before,\noverwhelming many towns, and an innumerable multitude of people.", "A.D. 1015.  This year was the great council at Oxford; where\nAlderman Edric betrayed Sigferth and Morcar, the eldest thanes\nbelonging to the Seven Towns.  He allured them into his bower,\nwhere they were shamefully slain.  Then the king took all their\npossessions, and ordered the widow of Sigferth to be secured, and\nbrought within Malmsbury.  After a little interval, Edmund\nEtheling went and seized her, against the king's will, and had\nher to wife.  Then, before the Nativity of St. Mary, went the\netheling west-north into the Five Towns, (58) and soon plundered\nall the property of Sigferth and Morcar; and all the people\nsubmitted to him.  At the same time came King Knute to Sandwich,\nand went soon all about Kent into Wessex, until he came to the\nmouth of the Frome; and then plundered in Dorset, and in\nWiltshire, and in Somerset.  King Ethelred, meanwhile, lay sick\nat Corsham; and Alderman Edric collected an army there, and\nEdmund the etheling in the north.  When they came together, the\nalderman designed to betray Edmund the etheling, but he could\nnot; whereupon they separated without an engagement, and sheered\noff from their enemies.  Alderman Edric then seduced forty ships\nfrom the king, and submitted to Knute.  The West-Saxons also\nsubmitted, and gave hostages, and horsed the army.  And he\ncontinued there until midwinter.", "A.D. 1016.  This year came King Knute with a marine force of one\nhundred and sixty ships, and Alderman Edric with him, over the\nThames into Mercia at Cricklade; whence they proceeded to\nWarwickshire, during the middle of the winter, and plundered\ntherein, and burned, and slew all they met.  Then began Edmund\nthe etheling to gather an army, which, when it was collected,\ncould avail him nothing, unless the king were there and they had\nthe assistance of the citizens of London.  The expedition\ntherefore was frustrated, and each man betook himself home.\nAfter this, an army was again ordered, under full penalties, that\nevery person, however distant, should go forth; and they sent to\nthe king in London, and besought him to come to meet the army\nwith the aid that he could collect.  When they were all\nassembled, it succeeded nothing better than it often did before;\nand, when it was told the king, that those persons would betray\nhim who ought to assist him, then forsook he the army, and\nreturned again to London.  Then rode Edmund the etheling to Earl\nUtred in Northumbria; and every man supposed that they would\ncollect an army King Knute; but they went into Stafforddhire, and\nto Shrewsbury, and to Chester; and they plundered on their parts,\nand Knute on his.  He went out through Buckinghamshire to\nBedfordshire; thence to Huntingdonshire, and so into\nNorthamptonshire along the fens to Stamford.  Thence into\nLincolnshire.  Thence to Nottinghamshire; and so into Northumbria\ntoward York.  When Utred understood this, he ceased from\nplundering, and hastened northward, and submitted for need, and\nall the Northumbrians with him; but, though he gave hostages, he\nwas nevertheless slain by the advice of Alderman Edric, and\nThurkytel, the son of Nafan, with him.  After this, King Knute\nappointed Eric earl over Northumbria, as Utred was; and then went\nsouthward another way, all by west, till the whole army came,\nbefore Easter, to the ships.  Meantime Edmund Etheling went to\nLondon to his father: and after Easter went King Knute with all\nhis ships toward London; but it happened that King Ethelred died\nere the ships came.  He ended his days on St. George's day;\nhaving held his kingdom in much tribulation and difficulty as\nlong as his life continued.  After his decease, all the peers\nthat were in London, and the citizens, chose Edmund king; who\nbravely defended his kingdom while his time was.  Then came the\nships to Greenwich, about the gang-days, and within a short\ninterval went to London; where they sunk a deep ditch on the\nsouth side, and dragged their ships to the west side of the\nbridge.  Afterwards they trenched the city without, so that no\nman could go in or out, and often fought against it: but the\ncitizens bravely withstood them.  King Edmund had ere this gone\nout, and invaded the West-Saxons, who all submitted to him; and\nsoon afterward he fought with the enemy at Pen near Gillingham.\nA second battle he fought, after midsummer, at Sherston; where\nmuch slaughter was made on either side, and the leaders\nthemselves came together in the fight.  Alderman Edric and Aylmer\nthe darling were assisting the army against King Edmund.  Then\ncollected he his force the third time, and went to London, all by\nnorth of the Thames, and so out through Clayhanger, and relieved\nthe citizens, driving the enemy to their ships.  It was within\ntwo nights after that the king went over at Brentford; where he\nfought with the enemy, and put them to flight: but there many of\nthe English were drowned, from their own carelessness; who went\nbefore the main army with a design to plunder.  After this the\nking went into Wessex, and collected his army; but the enemy soon\nreturned to London, and beset the city without, and fought\nstrongly against it both by water and land.  But the almighty God\ndelivered them.  The enemy went afterward from London with their\nships into the Orwell; where they went up and proceeded into\nMercia, slaying and burning whatsoever they overtook, as their\ncustom is; and, having provided themselves with meat, they drove\ntheir ships and their herds into the Medway.  Then assembled King\nEdmund the fourth time all the English nation, and forded over\nthe Thames at Brentford; whence he proceeded into Kent.  The\nenemy fled before him with their horses into the Isle of Shepey;\nand the king slew as many of them as he could overtake.  Alderman\nEdric then went to meet the king at Aylesford; than which no\nmeasure could be more ill-advised.  The enemy, meanwhile,\nreturned into Essex, and advanced into Mercia, destroying all\nthat he overtook.  When the king understood that the army was up,\nthen collected he the fifth time all the English nation, and went\nbehind them, and overtook them in Essex, on the down called\nAssingdon; where they fiercely came together.  Then did Alderman\nEdric as he often did before--he first began the flight with\nthe Maisevethians, and so betrayed his natural lord and all the\npeople of England.  There had Knute the victory, though all\nEngland fought against him!  There was then slain Bishop Ednoth,\nand Abbot Wulsy, and Alderman Elfric, and Alderman Godwin of\nLindsey, and Ulfkytel of East-Anglia, and Ethelward, the son of\nAlderman Ethelsy (59).  And all the nobility of the English\nnation was there undone!  After this fight went King Knute up\nwith his army into Glocestershire, where he heard say that King\nEdmund was.  Then advised Alderman Edric, and the counsellors\nthat were there assembled, that the kings should make peace with\neach other, and produce hostages.  Then both the kings met\ntogether at Olney, south of Deerhurst, and became allies and\nsworn brothers.  There they confirmed their friendship both with\npledges and with oaths, and settled the pay of the army.  With\nthis covenant they parted: King Edmund took to Wessex, and Knute\nto Mercia and the northern district.  The army then went to their\nships with the things they had taken; and the people of London\nmade peace with them, and purchased their security, whereupon\nthey brought their ships to London, and provided themselves\nwinter-quarters therein.  On the feast of St. Andrew died King\nEdmund; and he is buried with his grandfather Edgar at\nGastonbury.  In the same year died Wulfgar, Abbot of Abingdon;\nand Ethelsy took to the abbacy.", "A.D. 1017.

King Knute also\nbanished Edwy etheling, whom he afterwards ordered to be slain,\nand Edwy, king of the churls; and before the calends of August\nthe king gave an order to fetch him the widow of the other king,\nEthelred, the daughter of Richard, to wife.", "((A.D. 1017.

Ere this, in the same\nyear, died Grimkytel, Bishop of Sussex; and he lies at\nChrist-church, in Canterbury.  And Heca, the' king's priest,\nsucceeded to the bishopric.  Sweyne also sent hither, and\nrequested the aid of fifty ships against Magnus, king of the\nNorwegians; but it was thought unwise by all the people, and it\nwas prevented, because that Magnus had a large navy: and he drove\nSweyne out, and with much slaughter won the land.  The Danes then\ngave him much money, and received him as king.  The same year\nMagnus died.  The same year also Earl Sweyne went out to\nBaldwin's land, to Bruges; and remained there all the winter.  In\nthe summer he departed.", "A.D. 1046.  This year went Earl Sweyne into Wales; and Griffin,\nking of the northern men with him; and hostages were delivered to\nhim.  As he returned homeward, he ordered the Abbess of\nLeominster to be fetched him; and he had her as long as he list,\nafter which he let her go home.  In this same year was outlawed\nOsgod Clapa, the master of horse, before midwinter.  And in the\nsame year, after Candlemas, came the strong winter, with frost\nand with snow, and with all kinds of bad weather; so that there\nwas no man then alive who could remember so severe a winter as\nthis was, both through loss of men and through loss of cattle;\nyea, fowls and fishes through much cold and hunger perished.", "((A.D. 1046.  This year died Brithwin, bishop in Wiltshire, and\nHerman was appointed to his see.  In that year King Edward\ngathered a large ship-force at Sandwich, on account of the\nthreatening of Magnus in Norway: but his and Sweyn's contention\nin Denmark hindered his coming here.  This year died Athelstan,\nAbbot of Abingdon, and Sparhawk, monk of St. Edmund's-bury,\nsucceeded him.  And in this same year died bishop Siward, and\nArchbishop Eadsine again obtained the whole bishopric.  And in\nthis same year Lothen and Irling came with twenty-five ships to\nSandwich, and there took unspeakable booty, in men, and in gold,\nand in silver, so that no man knew how much it all was.  And they\nthen went about Thanet, and would there do the like; but the\nland's-folk strenuously withstood them, and denied them as well\nlanding as water; and thence utterly put them to flight.  And\nthey betook themselves then into Essex, and there they ravaged,\nand took men, and property, and whatsoever they might find.  And\nthey betook themselves then east to Baldwine's land, and there\nthey sold what they had plundered; and after that went their way\neast, whence they before had come.  In this year was the great\nsynod at St. Remi's [Rheins].  Thereat was Leo the pope, and the\nArchbishop of Burgundy [Lyons], and the Archbishop of Besancon,\nand the Archbishop of Treves, and the Archbishop of Rheims; and\nmany men besides, both clergy and laity.  And King Edward sent\nthither Bishop Dudoc [Of Wells], and Wulfric, Abbot of St.\nAugustine's, and Abbot Elfwin [Of Ramsey], that they might make\nknown to the king what should be there resolved on for\nChristendom.  And in this same year King Edward went out to\nSandwich with a great fleet.  And Sweyn the earl, son of Godwin\nthe earl, came in to Bosham with seven ships; and he obtained the\nking's protection, and he was promised that he should be held\nworthy of everything which he before possessed.  Then Harold the\nearl, his brother, and Beorn the earl contended that he should\nnot be held worthy of any of the things which the king had\ngranted to them: but a protection of four days was appointed him\nto go to his ships.  Then befell it during this, that word came\nto the king that hostile ships lay westward, and were ravaging.\nThen went Godwin the earl west about with two of the king's\nships; the one commanded Harold the earl, and the other Tosty his\nbrother; and forty-two of the people's ships.  Then Harold the\nearl was removed from the king's ship which Harold the earl\nbefore had commanded.  Then went they west to Pevensey, and lay\nthere weather-bound.  Upon this, after two days, then came Sweyn\nthe earl thither, and spoke with his father, and with Beorn the\nearl, and begged of Beorn that he would go with him to the king\nat Sandwich, and help him to the king's friendship: and he\ngranted it.  Then went they as if they would go to the king.\nThen whilst they were riding, then begged Sweyn of him that he\nwould go with him to his ships: saying that his seamen would\ndepart from him unless he should at the soonest come thither.\nThen went they both where his ships lay.  When they came thither,\nthen begged Sweyn the earl of him that he would go with him on\nship-board.  He strenuously refused, so long as until his seamen\nseized him, and threw him into the boat, and bound him, and rowed\nto the ship, and put him there aboard.  Then they hoisted up\ntheir sails and ran west to Exmouth, and had him with them until\nthey slew him: and they took the body and buried it in a church.\nAnd then his friends and litsmen came from London, and took him\nup, and bore him to Winchester to the Old-minster, and he is\nthere buried with King Canute his uncle.  And Sweyn went then\neast to Baldwin's land, and sat down there all the winter at\nBruges, with his full protection.  And in the same year died\nEadnoth [II.] bishop [Of Dorchester] of the north and Ulf was\nmade bishop.))", "A.D. 1047.  This year died Athelstan, Abbot of Abingdon, on the\nfourth day before the calends of April; and Sparhawk, monk of St.\nEdmundsbury, succeeded him.  Easter day was then on the third day\nbefore the nones of April; and there was over all England very\ngreat loss of men this year also.  The same year came to Sandwich\nLothen and Irling, with twenty-five ships, and plundered and took\nincalculable spoil, in men, and in gold, and in silver, so that\nno man wist what it all was; and went then about Thanet, and\nwould there have done the same; but the land-folk firmly\nwithstood, and resisted them both by land and sea, and thence put\nthem to flight withal.  They betook themselves thence into Essex,\nwhere they plundered and took men, and whatsoever they could\nfind, whence they departed eastward to Baldwin's land, and having\ndeposited the booty they had gained, they returned east to the\nplace whence they had come before.", "((A.D. 1047.  This year died Living the eloquent bishop, on the\ntenth before the kalends of April, and he had three bishoprics;\none in Devonshire, and in Cornwall, and in Worcester.  Then\nLeofric (61) succeeded to Devonshire and to Cornwall, and Bishop\nAldred to Worcester.  And in this year Osgod, the master of the\nhorse, was outlawed: and Magnus [King of Norway] won Denmark.  In\nthis year there was a great council in London at mid-Lent, and\nnine ships of lightermen were discharged, and five remained\nbehind.  In this same year came Sweyn the earl into England.  And\nin this same year was the great synod at Rome, and King Edward\nsent thither Bishop Heroman and Bishop Aldred; and they came\nthither on Easter eve.  And afterwards the pope held a synod at\nVercelli, and Bishop Ulf came thereto; and well nigh would they\nhave broken his staff, if he had not given very great gifts;\nbecause he knew not how to do his duty so well as he should.  And\nin this year died Archbishop Eadsine, on the fourth before the\nkalends of November.))", "A.D. 1048.  This year came Sweyne back to Denmark; and Harold,\nthe uncle of Magnus, went to Norway on the death of Magnus, and\nthe Northmen submitted to him.  He sent an embassy of peace to\nthis land, as did also Sweyne from Denmark, requesting of King\nEdward naval assistance to the amount at least of fifty ships;\nbut all the people resisted it.  This year also there was an\nearthquake, on the calends of May, in many places; at Worcester,\nat Wick, and at Derby, and elsewhere wide throughout England;\nwith very great loss by disease of men and of cattle over all\nEngland; and the wild fire in Derbyshire and elsewhere did much\nharm.  In the same year the enemy plundered Sandwich, and the\nIsle of Wight, and slew the best men that were there; and King\nEdward and the earls went out after them with their ships.  The\nsame year Bishop Siward resigned his bishopric from infirmity,\nand retired to Abingdon; upon which Archbishop Edsy resumed the\nbishopric; and he died within eight weeks of this, on the tenth\nday before the calends of November.", "((A.D. 1048.  This year was the severe winter: and this year died\nAlwyn, Bishop of Winchester, and Bishop Stigand was raised to his\nsee.  And before that, in the same year, died Grinketel, Bishop\nin Sussex, and Heca the priest succeeded to the bishopric.  And\nSweyn also sent hither, begging assistance against Magnus, King\nof Norway; that fifty ships should be sent to his aid.  But it\nseemed unadvisable to all people: and it was then hindered by\nreason that Magnus had a great ship-force.  And he then drove out\nSweyn, and with much man-slaying won the land: and the Danes paid\nhim much money and acknowledged him as king.  And that same year\nMagnus died.  In this year King Edward appointed Robert, of\nLondon, Archbishop of Canterbury, during Lent.  And in the same\nLent he went to Rome after his pall: and the king gave the\nbishopric of London to Sparhafoc, Abbot of Abingdon; and the king\ngave the abbacy of Abingdon to Bishop Rodulf, his kinsman.  Then\ncame the archbishop from Rome one day before St. Peter's mass-eve,\nand entered on his archiepiscopal see at Christ's Church on\nSt. Peter's mass-day; and soon after went to the king.  Then came\nAbbot Sparhafoc to him with the king's writ and seal, in order\nthat he should consecrate him Bishop of London.  Then the\narchbishop refused, and said that the pope had forbidden it him.\nThen went the abbot to the archbishop again for that purpose, and\nthere desired episcopal ordination; and the archbishop constantly\nrefused him, and said that the pope had forbidden it him.  Then\nwent the abbot to London, and occupied the bishopric which the\nking before had granted him, with his full leave, all the summer\nand the harvest.  And then came Eustace [Earl of Boulogne] from\nbeyond sea soon after the bishop, and went to the king, and spoke\nwith him that which he then would, and went then homeward.  When\nhe came to Canterbury, east, then took he refreshment there, and\nhis men, and went to Dover.  When he was some mile or more, on\nthis side of Dover, then he put on his breast-plate, and so did\nall his companions, and went to Dover.  When they came thither,\nthen would they lodge themselves where they chose.  Then came one\nof his men, and would abide in the house of a householder against\nhis will, and wounded the householder; and the householder slew\nthe other.  Then Eustace got upon his horse, and his companions\nupon theirs; and they went to the householder, and slew him\nwithin his own dwelling; and they went up towards the town, and\nslew, as well within as without, more than twenty men.  And the\ntownsmen slew nineteen men on the other side, and wounded they\nknew not how many.  And Eustace escaped with a few men, and went\nagain to the king, and made known to him, in part, how they had\nfared.  And the king became very wroth with the townsmen.  And\nthe king sent off Godwin the earl, and bade him go into Kent in a\nhostile manner to Dover: for Eustace had made it appear to the\nking, that it had been more the fault of the townsmen than his:\nbut it was not so.  And the earl would not consent to the inroad,\nbecause he was loth to injure his own people.  Then the king sent\nafter all his council, and bade them come to Gloucester, nigh the\naftermass of St. Mary.  Then had the Welshmen erected a castle in\nHerefordshire among the people of Sweyn the earl, and wrought\nevery kind of harm and disgrace to the king's men there about\nwhich they could.  Then came Godwin the earl, and Sweyn the earl,\nand Harold the earl, together at Beverstone, and many men with\nthem, in order that they might go to their royal lord, and to all\nthe peers who were assembled with him, in order that they might\nhave the advice of the king and his aid, and of all this council,\nhow they might avenge the king's disgrace, and the whole\nnation's.  Then were the Welshmen with the king beforehand, and\naccused the earls, so that they might not come within his eyes'\nsight; because they said that they were coming thither in order\nto betray the king.  Thither had come Siward the earl [Of\nNorthumbria] and Leofric the earl [Of Mercia], and much people\nwith them, from the north, to the king; and it was made known to\nthe Earl Godwin and his sons, that the king and the men who were\nwith him, were taking counsel concerning them: and they arrayed\nthemselves on the other hand resolutely, though it were loathful\nto them that they should stand against their royal lord.  Then\nthe peers on either side decreed that every kind of evil should\ncease: and the king gave the peace of God and his full friendship\nto either side.  Then the king and his peers decreed that a\ncouncil of all the nobles should be held for the second time in\nLondon at the harvest equinox; and the king directed the army to\nbe called out, as well south of the Thames as north, all that was\nin any way most eminent.  Then declared they Sweyn the earl an\noutlaw, and summoned Godwin the earl and Harold the earl, to the\ncouncil, as quickly as they could effect it.  When they had come\nthither, then were they summoned into the council.  Then required\nhe safe conduct and hostages, so that he might come, unbetrayed,\ninto the council and out of the council.  Then the king demanded\nall the thanes whom the earls before had: and they granted them\nall into his hands.  Then the king sent again to them, and\ncommanded them that they should come with twelve men to the\nking's council.  Then the earl again required safe conduct and\nhostages, that he might defend himself against each of those\nthings which were laid to him.  Then were the hostages refused\nhim; and he was allowed a safe conduct for five nights to go out\nof the land.  And then Godwin the earl and Sweyn the earl went to\nBosham, and shoved out their ships, and betook themselves beyond\nsea, and sought Baldwin's protection, and abode there all the\nwinter.  And Harold the earl went west to Ireland, and was there\nall the winter within the king's protection.  And soon after this\nhappened, then put away the king the lady who had been\nconsecrated his queen [Editha], and caused to be taken from her\nall which she possessed, in land, and in gold, and in silver, and\nin all things, and delivered her to his sister at Wherwell.  And\nAbbot Sparhafoc was then driven out of the bishopric of London,\nand William the king's priest was ordained thereto.  And then\nOdda was appointed earl over Devonshire, and over Somerset, and\nover Dorset, and over the Welsh.  And Algar, the son of Leofric\nthe earl, was appointed to the earldom which Harold before\nheld.))", "A.D. 1049. (62)  This year the emperor gathered an innumerable\narmy against Baldwin of Bruges, because he had destroyed the\npalace of Nimeguen, and because of many other ungracious acts\nthat he did against him.  The army was immense that he had\ncollected together.  There was Leo, the Pope of Rome, and the\npatriarch, and many other great men of several provinces.  He\nsent also to King Edward, and requested of him naval aid, that he\nmight not permit him to escape from him by water.  Whereupon he\nwent to Sandwich, and lay there with a large naval armament,\nuntil the emperor had all that he wished of Baldwin.  Thither\nalso came back again Earl Sweyne, who had gone from this land to\nDenmark, and there ruined his cause with the Danes.  He came\nhither with a pretence, saying that he would again submit to the\nking, and be his man; and he requested Earl Beorn to be of\nassistance to him, and give him land to feed him on.  But Harold,\nhis brother, and Earl Beorn resisted, and would give him nothing\nof that which the king had given them.  The king also refused him\neverything.  Whereupon Swevne retired to his ships at Bosham.\nThen, after the settlement between the emperor and Baldwin, many\nships went home, and the king remained behind Sandwich with a few\nships.  Earl Godwin also sailed forty-two ships from Sandwich to\nPevensey, and Earl Beorn went with him.  Then the king gave leave\nto all the Mercians to return home, and they did so.  Then it was\ntold the king that Osgod lay at Ulps with thirty-nine ships;\nwhereupon the king sent after the ships that he might dispatch,\nwhich before had gone homewards, but still lay at the Nore.  Then\nOsgod fetched his wife from Bruges; and they went back again with\nsix ships; but the rest went towards Essex, to Eadulf's-ness, and\nthere plundered, and then returned to their ships.  But there\ncame upon them a strong wind, so that they were all lost but four\npersons, who were afterwards slain beyond sea.  Whilst Earl\nGodwin and Earl Beorn lay at Pevensey with their ships, came Earl\nSweyne, and with a pretence requested of Earl Beorn, who was his\nuncle's son, that he would be his companion to the king at\nSandwich, and better his condition with him; adding, that he\nwould swear oaths to him, and be faithful to him.  Whereupon\nBeorn concluded, that he would not for their relationship betray\nhim.  He therefore took three companions with him, and they rode\nto Bosham, where his (63) ships lay, as though they should\nproceed to Sandwich; but they suddenly bound him, and led him to\nthe ships, and went thence with him to Dartmouth, where they\nordered him to be slain and buried deep.  He was afterwards\nfound, and Harold his cousin fetched him thence, and led him to\nWinchester, to the old minster, where he buried him with King\nKnute, his uncle.  Then the king and all the army proclaimed\nSweyne an outlaw.  A little before this the men of Hastings and\nthereabout fought his two ships with their ships, and slew all\nthe men, and brought the ships to Sandwich to the king.  Eight\nships had he, ere he betrayed Beorn; afterwards they all forsook\nhim except two; whereupon he went eastward to the land of\nBaldwin, and sat there all the winter at Bruges, in full\nsecurity.  In the same year came up from Ireland thirty-six ships\non the Welsh coast, and thereabout committed outrages, with the\naid of Griffin, the Welsh king.  The people were soon gathered\nagainst them, and there was also with them Bishop Eldred, but\nthey had too little assistance, and the enemy came unawares on\nthem very early in the morning, and slew on the spot many good\nmen; but the others burst forth with the bishop.  This was done\non the fourth day before the calends of August.  This year died\nthe good Bishop Ednoth in Oxfordshire; and Oswy, Abbot of Thomey;\nand Wulfnoth, Abbot of Westminster; and King Edward gave the\nbishopric which Ednoth had to Ulf his priest, but it ill betided\nhim; and he was driven from it, because he did nought like a\nbishop therein, so that it shameth us now to say more.  Bishop\nSiward also died who lies at Abingdon.  In this same year King\nEdward put nine ships out of pay; and the crews departed, and\nwent away with the ships withal, leaving five ships only behind,\nfor whom the king ordered twelve months pay.  The same year went\nBishops Hereman and Aldred to the pope at Rome on the king's\nerrand.  This year was also consecrated the great minster at\nRheims, in the presence of Pope Leo and the emperor.  There was\nalso a great synod at St. Remy; (64) at which was present Pope\nLeo, with the Archbishops of Burgundy, of Besancon, of Treves,\nand of Rheims; and many wise men besides, both clergy and laity.\nA great synod there held they respecting the service of God, at\nthe instance of St. Leo the pope.  It is difficult to recognise\nall the bishops that came thither, and also abbots.  King Edward\nsent thither Bishop Dudoc, and Abbot Wulfric, of St. Augustine's,\nand Elfwin, Abbot of Ramsey, with the intent that they should\nreport to the king what was determined there concerning\nChristendom.  This same year came Earl Sweyne into England.", "((A.D. 1049.  This year Sweyn came again to Denmark, and Harold.\nuncle of Magnus, went to Norway after Magnus was dead; and the\nNormans acknowledged him: and he sent hither to land concerning\npeace.  And Sweyn also sent from Denmark, and begged of King\nEdward the aid of his ships.  They were to be at least fifty\nships: but all people opposed it.  And this year also there was\nan earthquake,  on the kalends of May, in many places in\nWorcester, and in Wick, and in Derby, and elsewhere; and also\nthere was a great mortality among men, and murrain among cattle:\nand moreover, the wild-fire did much evil in Derbyshire and\nelsewhere.))", "A.D. 1050.  This year returned the bishops home from Rome; (65)\nand Earl Sweyne had his sentence of outlawry reversed.  The same\nyear died Edsy, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the fourth day\nbefore the calends of November; and also in the same year Elfric,\nArchbishop of York, on the eleventh before the calends of\nFebruary, a very venerable man and wise, and his body lies at\nPeterborough.  Then had King Edward a meeting of the great\ncouncil in London, in mid-lent, at which he appointed Robert the\nFrank, who was before Bishop of London, Archbishop of Canterbury;\nand he, during the same Lent, went to Rome after his pall.  The\nking meanwhile gave the see of London to Sparhawk, Abbot of\nAbingdon, but it was taken from him again before he was\nconsecrated.  The king also gave the abbacy of Abingdon to Bishop\nRodulph his cousin.  The same year he put all the lightermen out\nof pay. (66)  The pope held a council again, at Vercelli; and\nBishop Ulf came thither, where he nearly had his staff broken,\nhad he not paid more money, because he could not perform his\nduties so well as he should do.  The same year King Edward\nabolished the Danegeld which King Ethelred imposed.  That was in\nthe thirty-ninth year after it had begun.  That tribute harassed\nall the people of England so long as is above written; and it was\nalways paid before other imposts, which were levied\nindiscriminately, and vexed men variously.", "((A.D. 1050.  Thither also came Sweyn the earl, who before had\ngone from this land to Denmark, and who there had ruined himself\nwith the Danes.  He came thither with false pretences; saying\nthat he would again be obedient to the king.  And Beorn the earl\npromised him that he would be of assistance to him.  Then, after\nthe reconciliation of the emperor and of Baldwin, many of the\nships went home, and the king remained behind at Sandwich with a\nfew ships; and Godwin the earl also went with forty-two ships\nfrom Sandwich to Pevensey, and Beorn the earl went with him.\nThen was it made known to the king that Osgood lay at Ulps with\nthirty-nine ships; and the king then sent after the ships which\nbefore had gone home, that he might send after him.  And Osgod\nfetched his wife from Bruges, and they went back again with six\nships.  And the others landed in Sussex [Essex] at Eadulf-ness,\nand there did harm, and went again to their ships: and then a\nstrong wind came against them, so that they were all destroyed,\nexcept four, whose crews were slain beyond sea.  While Godwin the\nearl and Beorn the earl lay at Pevensey, then came Sweyn the\nearl, and begged Beorn the earl, with fraud, who was his uncle's\nson, that he would be his companion to the king at Sandwich, and\nbetter his affairs with him.  He went then, on account of the\nrelationship, with three companions, with him; and he led him\nthen towards Bosham, where his ships lay: and then they bound\nhim, and led him on ship-board.  Then went he thence with him to\nDartmouth, and there ordered him to be slain, and deeply buried.\nAfterwards he was found, and borne to Winchester, and buried with\nking Canute his uncle.  A little before that, the men of Hastings\nand thereabout, fought two of his ships with their ships; and\nslew all the men, and brought the ships to Sandwich to the king.\nEight ships he had before he betrayed Beorn; after that all\nforsook him except two.  In the same year arrived in the Welsh\nAxa, from Ireland, thirty-six ships, and thereabout did harm,\nwith the help of Griffin the Welsh king.  The people were\ngathered together against them; Bishop Aldred [Of Worchester] was\nalso there with them; but they had too little power.  And they\ncame unawares upon them at very early morn; and there they slew\nmany good men, and the others escaped with the bishop: this was\ndone on the fourth before the kalends of August.  This year died,\nin Oxfordshire, Oswy, Abbot of Thorney, and Wulfnoth, Abbot of\nWestminster; and Ulf the priest was appointed as pastor to the\nbishopric which Eadnoth had held; but he was after that driven\naway; because he did nothing bishop-like therein: so that it\nshameth us now to tell more about it.  And Bishop Siward died: he\nlieth at Abingdon.  And this year was consecrated the great\nminster at Rheims: there was Pope Leo [IX.] and the emperor\n[Henry III]; and there they held a great synod concerning God's\nservice.  St. Leo the pope presided at the synod: it is difficult\nto have a knowledge of the bishops who came there, and how many\nabbots: and hence, from this land were sent two--from St.\nAugustine's and from Ramsey.))", "A.D. 1051.  This year came Archbishop Robert hither over sea with\nhis pall from Rome, one day before St. Peter's eve: and he took\nhis archiepiscopal seat at Christ-church on St. Peter's day, and\nsoon after this went to the king.  Then came Abbot Sparhawk to\nhim with the king's writ and seal, to the intent that he should\nconsecrate him Bishop o[oe] London; but the archbishop refused,\nsaying that the pope had forbidden him.  Then went the abbot to\nthe archbishop again for the same purpose, and there demanded\nepiscopal consecration; but the archbishop obstinately refused,\nrepeating that the pope had forbidden him.  Then went the abbot\nto London, and sat at the bishopric which the king had before\ngiven him, with his full leave, all the summer and the autumn.\nThen during the same year came Eustace, who had the sister of\nKing Edward to wife, from beyond sea, soon after the bishop, and\nwent to the king; and having spoken with him whatever he chose,\nhe then went homeward.  When he came to Canterbury eastward,\nthere took he a repast, and his men; whence he proceeded to\nDover.  When he was about a mile or more on this side Dover, he\nput on his breast-plate; and so did all his companions: and they\nproceeded to Dover.  When they came thither, they resolved to\nquarter themselves wherever they lived.  Then came one of his\nmen, and would lodge at the house of a master of a family against\nhis will; but having wounded the master of the house, he was\nslain by the other.  Then was Eustace quickly upon his horse, and\nhis companions upon theirs; and having gone to the master of the\nfamily, they slew him on his own hearth; then going up to the\nboroughward, they slew both within and without more than twenty\nmen.  The townsmen slew nineteen men on the other side, and\nwounded more, but they knew not how many.  Eustace escaped with a\nfew men, and went again to the king, telling him partially how\nthey had fared.  The king was very wroth with the townsmen, and\nsent off Earl Godwin, bidding him go into Kent with hostility to\nDover.  For Eustace had told the king that the guilt of the\ntownsmen was greater than his.  But it was not so: and the earl\nwould not consent to the expedition, because he was loth to\ndestroy his own people.  Then sent the king after all his\ncouncil, and bade them come to Gloucester nigh the after-mass of\nSt. Mary.  Meanwhile Godwin took it much to heart, that in his\nearldom such a thing should happen.  Whereupon be began to gather\nforces over all his earldom, and Earl Sweyne, his son, over his;\nand Harold, his other son, over his earldom: and they assembled\nall in Gloucestershire, at Langtree, a large and innumerable\narmy, all ready for battle against the king; unless Eustace and\nhis men were delivered to them handcuffed, and also the Frenchmen\nthat were in the castle.  This was done seven nights before the\nlatter mass of St. Mary, when King Edward was sitting at\nGloucester.  Whereupon he sent after Earl Leofric, and north\nafter Earl Siward, and summoned their retinues.  At first they\ncame to him with moderate aid; but when they found how it was in\nthe south, then sent they north over all their earldom, and\nordered a large force to the help of their lord.  So did Ralph\nalso over his earldom.  Then came they all to Gloucester to\nthe aid of the king, though it was late.  So unanimous were they\nall in defence of the king, that they would seek Godwin's army if\nthe king desired it.  But some prevented that; because it was\nvery unwise that they should come together; for in the two armies\nwas there almost all that was noblest in England.  They therefore\nprevented this, that they might not leave the land at the mercy\nof our foes, whilst engaged in a destructive conflict betwixt\nourselves.  Then it was advised that they should exchange\nhostages between them.  And they issued proclamations throughout\nto London, whither all the people were summoned over all this\nnorth end in Siward's earldom, and in Leofric's, and also\nelsewhere; and Earl Godwin was to come thither with his sons to a\nconference; They came as far as Southwark, and very many with\nthem from Wessex; but his army continually diminished more and\nmore; for they bound over to the king all the thanes that\nbelonged to Earl Harold his son, and outlawed Earl Sweyne his\nother son.  When therefore it could not serve his purpose to come\nto a conference against the king and against the army that was\nwith him, he went in the night away.  In the morning the king\nheld a council, and proclaimed him an outlaw, with his whole\narmy; himself and his wife, and all his three sons--Sweyne and\nTosty and Grith.  And he went south to Thorney, (67) with his\nwife, and Sweyne his son, and Tosty and his wife, a cousin of\nBaldwin of Bruges, and his son Grith.  Earl Harold with Leofwine\nwent to Bristol in the ship that Earl Sweyne had before prepared\nand provisioned for himself; and the king sent Bishop Aldred from\nLondon with his retinue, with orders to overtake him ere he came\nto ship.  But they either could not or would not: and he then\nwent out from the mouth of the Avon; but he encountered such\nadverse weather, that he got off with difficulty, and suffered\ngreat loss.  He then went forth to Ireland, as soon as the\nweather permitted.  In the meantime the Welshmen had wrought a\ncastle in Herefordshire, in the territory of Earl Sweyne, and\nbrought as much injury and disgrace on the king's men thereabout\nas they could.  Then came Earl Godwin, and Earl Sweyne, and Earl\nHarold, together at Beverstone, and many men with them; to the\nintent that they might go to their natural lord, and to all the\npeers that were assembled with him; to have the king's counsel\nand assistance, and that of all the peers, how they might avenge\nthe insult offered to the king, and to all the nation.  But the\nWelshmen were before with the king, and bewrayed the earls, so\nthat they were not permitted to come within the sight of his\neyes; for they declared that they intended to come thither to\nbetray the king.  There was now assembled before the king (68)\nEarl Siward, and Earl Leofric, and much people with them from the\nnorth: and it was told Earl Godwin and his sons, that the king\nand the men who were with him would take counsel against them;\nbut they prepared themselves firmly to resist, though they were\nloth to proceed against their natural lord.  Then advised the\npeers on either side, that they should abstain from all\nhostility: and the king gave God's peace and his full friendship\nto each party.  Then advised the king and his council, that there\nshould be a second time a general assembly of all the nobles in\nLondon, at the autumnal equinox: and the king ordered out an army\nboth south and north of the Thames, the best that ever was.  Then\nwas Earl Sweyne proclaimed an outlaw; and Earl Godwin and Earl\nHarold were summoned to the council as early as they could come.\nWhen they came thither and were cited to the council, then\nrequired they security and hostages, that they might come into\nthe council and go out without treachery.  The king then demanded\nall the thanes that the earls had; and they put them all into his\nhands.  Then sent the king again to them, and commanded them to\ncome with twelve men to the king's council.  Then desired the\nearl again security and hostages, that he might answer singly to\neach of the things that were laid to his charge.  But the\nhostages were refused; and a truce of five nights was allowed him\nto depart from the land.  Then went Earl Godwin and Earl Sweyne\nto Bosham, and drew out their ships, and went beyond sea, seeking\nthe protection of Baldwin; and there they abode all the winter.\nEarl Harold went westward to Ireland, and was there all the\nwinter on the king's security.  It was from Thorney (69) that\nGodwin and those that were with him went to Bruges, to Baldwin's\nland, in one ship, with as much treasure as they could lodge\ntherein for each man.  Wonderful would it have been thought by\nevery man that was then in England, if any person had said before\nthis that it would end thus!  For he was before raised to such a\nheight, that he ruled the king and all England; his sons were\nearls, and the king's darlings; and his daughter wedded and\nunited to the king.  Soon after this took place, the king\ndismissed the lady who had been consecrated his queen, and\nordered to be taken from her all that she had in land, and in\ngold, and in silver, and in all things; and committed her to the\ncare of his sister at Wherwell.  Soon after came Earl William\nfrom beyond sea with a large retinue of Frenchmen; and the king\nentertained him and as many of his companions as were convenient\nto him, and let him depart again.  Then was Abbot Sparhawk driven\nfrom his bishopric at London; and William the king's priest was\ninvested therewith.  Then was Oddy appointed earl over\nDevonshire, and over Somerset, and over Dorset, and over Wales;\nand Algar, the son of Earl Leofric, was promoted to the earldom\nwhich Harold before possessed.", "((A.D. 1051.  In this year died Eadsine, Archbishop of\nCanterbury; and the king gave to Robert the Frenchman, who before\nhad been Bishop of London, the archbishopric.  And Sparhafoc,\nAbbot of Abingdon, succeeded to the bishopric of London; and it\nwas afterwards taken from him before he was consecrated.  And\nBishop Heroman and Bishop Aldred went to Rome.))", "A.D. 1052.  This year, on the second day before the nones of\nMarch, died the aged Lady Elfgiva Emma, the mother of King Edward\nand of King Hardacnute, the relict of King Ethelred and of King\nKnute; and her body lies in the old minster with King Knute.  At\nthis time Griffin, the Welsh king, plundered in Herefordshire\ntill he came very nigh to Leominster; and they gathered against\nhim both the landsmen and the Frenchmen from the castle; and\nthere were slain very many good men of the English, and also of\nthe French.  This was on the same day thirteen years after that\nEdwin was slain with his companions.  In the same year advised\nthe king and his council, that ships should be sent out to\nSandwich, and that Earl Ralph and Earl Odda should be appointed\nheadmen thereto.  Then went Earl Godwin out from Bruges with his\nships to Ysendyck; and sailed forth one day before midsummer-eve,\ntill he came to the Ness that is to the south of Romney.  When it\ncame to the knowledge of the earls out at Sandwich, they went out\nafter the other ships; and a land-force was also ordered out\nagainst the ships.  Meanwhile Earl Godwin had warning, and betook\nhimself into Pevensey: and the weather was so boisterous, that\nthe earls could not learn what had become of Earl Godwin.  But\nEarl Godwin then went out again until he came back to Bruges; and\nthe other ships returned back again to Sandwich.  Then it was\nadvised that the ships should go back again to London, and that\nother earls and other pilots should be appointed over them.  But\nit was delayed so long that the marine army all deserted; and\nthey all betook themselves home.  When Earl Godwin understood\nthat, he drew up his sail and his ship: and they (70) went west\nat once to the Isle of Wight; and landing there, they plundered\nso long that the people gave them as much as they required of\nthem.  Then proceeded they westward until they came to Portland,\nwhere they landed and did as much harm as they could possibly do.\nMeanwhile Harold had gone out from Ireland with nine ships, and\ncame up at Potlock with his ships to the mouth of the Severn,\nnear the boundaries of Somerset and Devonshire, and there\nplundered much.  The land-folk collected against him, both from\nSomerset and from Devonshire: but he put them to flight, and slew\nthere more than thirty good thanes, besides others; and went soon\nafter about Penwithstert, where was much people gathered against\nhim; but he spared not to provide himself with meat, and went up\nand slew on the spot a great number of the people--seizing in\ncattle, in men, and in money, whatever he could.  Then went he\neastward to his father; and they went both together eastward (71)\nuntil they came to the Isle of Wight, where they seized whatever\nhad been left them before.  Thence they went to Pevensey, and got\nout with them as many ships as had gone in there, and so\nproceeded forth till they came to the Ness; (72) getting all the\nships that were at Romney, and at Hithe, and at Folkstone.  Then\nordered King Edward to fit out forty smacks that lay at Sandwich\nmany weeks, to watch Earl Godwin, who was at Bruges during the\nwinter; but he nevertheless came hither first to land, so as to\nescape their notice.  And whilst he abode in this land, he\nenticed to him all the Kentish men, and all the boatmen from\nHastings, and everywhere thereabout by the sea-coast, and all the\nmen of Essex and Sussex and Surrey, and many others besides.\nThen said they all that they would with him live or die.  When\nthe fleet that lay at Sandwich had intelligence about Godwin's\nexpedition, they set sail after him; but he escaped them, and\nbetook himself wherever he might: and the fleet returned to\nSandwich, and so homeward to London.  When Godwin understood that\nthe fleet that lay at Sandwich was gone home, then went he back\nagain to the Isle of Wight, and lay thereabout by the sea-coast\nso long that they came together--he and his son Earl Harold.\nBut they did no great harm after they came together; save that\nthey took meat, and enticed to them all the land-folk by the\nsea-coast and also upward in the land.  And they proceeded toward\nSandwich, ever alluring forth with them all the boatmen that they\nmet; and to Sandwich they came with an increasing army.  They\nthen steered eastward round to Dover, and landing there, took as\nmany ships and hostages as they chose, and so returned to\nSandwich, where they did the same; and men everywhere gave them\nhostages and provisions, wherever they required them.  Then\nproceeded they to the Nore, and so toward London; but some of the\nships landed on the Isle of Shepey, and did much harm there;\nwhence they steered to Milton Regis, and burned it all, and then\nproceeded toward London after the earls.  When they came to\nLondon, there lay the king and all his earls to meet them, with\nfifty ships.  The earls (73) then sent to the king, praying that\nthey might be each possessed of those things which had been\nunjustly taken from them.  But the king resisted some while; so\nlong that the people who were with the earl were very much\nstirred against the king and against his people, so that the earl\nhimself with difficulty appeased them.  When King Edward\nunderstood that, then sent he upward after more aid; but they\ncame very late.  And Godwin stationed himself continually before\nLondon with his fleet, till he came to Southwark; where he abode\nsome time, until the flood (74) came up.  On this occasion he\nalso contrived with the burgesses that they should do almost all\nthat he would.  When he had arranged his whole expedition, then\ncame the flood; and they soon weighed anchor, and steered through\nthe bridge by the south side.  The land-force meanwhile came\nabove, and arranged themselves by the Strand; and they formed\nan angle with the ships against the north side, as if they wished\nto surround the king's ships.  The king had also a great\nland-force on his side, to add to his shipmen: but they were most of\nthem loth to fight with their own kinsmen--for there was little\nelse of any great importance but Englishmen on either side; and\nthey were also unwilling that this land should be the more\nexposed to outlandish people, because they destroyed each other.\nThen it was determined that wise men should be sent between them,\nwho should settle peace on either side.  Godwin went up, and\nHarold his son, and their navy, as many as they then thought\nproper.  Then advanced Bishop Stigand with God's assistance, and\nthe wise men both within the town and without; who determined\nthat hostages should be given on either side.  And so they did.\nWhen Archbishop Robert and the Frenchmen knew that, they took\nhorse; and went some west to Pentecost Castle, some north to\nRobert's castle.  Archbishop Robert and Bishop Ulf, with their\ncompanions, went out at Eastgate, slaying or else maiming many\nyoung men, and betook themselves at once to Eadulf's-ness; where\nhe put himself on board a crazy ship, and went at once over sea,\nleaving his pall and all Christendom here on land, as God\nordained, because he had obtained an honour which God disclaimed.\nThen was proclaimed a general council without London; and all the\nearls and the best men in the land were at the council.  There\ntook up Earl Godwin his burthen, and cleared himself there before\nhis lord King Edward, and before all the nation; proving that he\nwas innocent of the crime laid to his charge, and to his son\nHarold and all his children.  And the king gave the earl and his\nchildren, and all the men that were with him, his full\nfriendship, and the full earldom, and all that he possessed\nbefore; and he gave the lady all that she had before.  Archbishop\nRobert was fully proclaimed an outlaw, with all the Frenchmen;\nbecause they chiefly made the discord between Earl Godwin and the\nking: and Bishop Stigand succeeded to the archbishopric at\nCanterbury.  At the council therefore they gave Godwin fairly his\nearldom, so full and so free as he at first possessed it; and his\nsons also all that they formerly had; and his wife and his\ndaughter so full and so free as they formerly had.  And they\nfastened full friendship between them, and ordained good laws to\nall people.  Then they outlawed all Frenchmen--who before\ninstituted bad laws, and judged unrighteous judgment, and brought\nbad counsels into this land--except so many as they concluded\nit was agreeable to the king to have with him, who were true to\nhim and to all his people.  It was with difficulty that Bishop\nRobert, and Bishop William, and Bishop Ulf, escaped with the\nFrenchmen that were with them, and so went over sea.  Earl\nGodwin, and Harold, and the queen, sat in their stations.  Sweyne\nhad before gone to Jerusalem from Bruges, and died on his way\nhome at Constantinople, at Michaelmas.  It was on the Monday\nafter the festival of St. Mary, that Godwin came with his ships\nto Southwark: and on the morning afterwards, on the Tuesday, they\nwere reconciled as it stands here before recorded.  Godwin then\nsickened soon after he came up, and returned back.  But he made\naltogether too little restitution of God's property, which he\nacquired from many places.  At the same time Arnwy, Abbot of\nPeterborough, resigned his abbacy in full health; and gave it to\nthe monk Leofric, with the king's leave and that of the monks;\nand the Abbot Arnwy lived afterwards eight winters.  The Abbot\nLeofric gilded the minster, so that it was called Gildenborough;\nand it then waxed very much in land, and in gold, and in silver.", "((A.D. 1052.  This year died Alfric, Archbishop of York, a very\npious man, and wise.  And in the same year King Edward abolished\nthe tribute, which King Ethelred had before imposed: that was in\nthe nine-and-thirtieth year after he had begun it.  That tax\ndistressed all the English nation during so long a time, as it\nhas been written; that was ever before other taxes which were\nvariously paid, and wherewith the people were manifestly\ndistressed.  In the same year Eustace [Earl of Boulougne] landed\nat Dover: he had King Edward's sister to wife.  Then went his men\ninconsiderately after quarters, and a certain man of the town\nthey slew; and another man of the town their companion; so that\nthere lay seven of his companions.  And much harm was there done\non either side, by horse and also by weapons, until the people\ngathered together: and then they fled away until they came to the\nking at Gloucester; and he gave them protection.  When Godwin,\nthe earl, understood that such things should have happened in his\nearldom, then began he to gather together people over all his\nearldom, (75) and Sweyn, the earl, his son, over his, and Harold,\nhis other son, over his earldom; and they all drew together in\nGloucestershire, at Langtree, a great force and countless, all\nready for battle against the king, unless Eustace were given up,\nand his men placed in their hands, and also the Frenchmen who\nwere in the castle.  This was done seven days before the latter\nmass of St. Mary.  Then was King Edward sitting at Gloucester.\nThen sent he after Leofric the earl [Of Mercia] and north after\nSiward the earl [Of Northumbria] and begged their forces.  And\nthen they came to him; first with a moderate aid, but after they\nknew how it was there, in the south, then sent they north over\nall their earldoms, and caused to be ordered out a large force\nfor the help of their lord; and Ralph, also, over his earldom:\nand then came they all to Gloucester to help the king, though it\nmight be late.  Then were they all so united in opinion with the\nking that they would have sought out Godwin's forces if the king\nhad so willed.  Then thought some of them that it would be a\ngreat folly that they should join battle; because there was\nnearly all that was most noble in England in the two armies, and\nthey thought that they should expose the land to our foes, and\ncause great destruction among ourselves.  Then counselled they\nthat hostages should be given mutually; and they appointed a term\nat London, and thither the people were ordered out over all this\nnorth end, in Siward's earldom, and in Leofric's, and also\nelsewhere; and Godwin, the earl, and his sons were to come there\nwith their defence.  Then came they to Southwark, and a great\nmultitude with them, from Wessex; but his band continually\ndiminished the longer he stayed.  And they exacted pledges for\nthe king from all the thanes who were under Harold, the earl, his\nson; and then they outlawed Sweyn, the earl, his other son.  Then\ndid it not suit him to come with a defence to meet the king, and\nto meet the army which was with him.  Then went he by night away;\nand the king on the morrow held a council, and, together with all\nthe army, declared him an outlaw, him and all his sons.  And he\nwent south to Thorney, and his wife, and Sweyn his son, and Tosty\nand his wife, Baldwin's relation of Bruges, and Grith his son.\nAnd Harold, the earl, and Leofwine, went to Bristol in the ship\nwhich Sweyn, the earl, had before got ready for himself, and\nprovisioned.  And the king sent Bishop Aldred [Of Worcester] to\nLondon with a force; and they were to overtake him ere he came on\nship-board: but they could not or they would not.  And he went\nout from Avonmouth, and met with such heavy weather that he with\ndifficulty got away; and there he sustained much damage.  Then\nwent he forth to Ireland when fit weather came.  And Godwin, and\nthose who were with him, went from Thorney to Bruges, to\nBaldwin's land, in one ship, with as much treasure as they might\ntherein best stow for each man.  It would have seemed wondrous to\nevery man who was in England if any one before that had said that\nit should end thus; for he had been erewhile to that degree\nexalted, as if he ruled the king and all England; and his sons\nwere earls and the king's darlings, and his daughter wedded and\nunited to the king: she was brought to Wherwell, and they\ndelivered her to the abbess.  Then, soon, came William, the earl\n[Of Normandy], from beyond seas with a great band of Frenchmen;\nand the king received him, and as many of his companions as it\npleased him; and let him away again.  This same year was given to\nWilliam, the priest, the bishopric of London, which before had\nbeen given to Sparhafoc.))", "((A.D. 1052.  This year died Elfgive, the lady, relict of King\nEthelred and of King Canute, on the second before the nones of\nMarch.  In the same year Griffin, the Welsh king, plundered in\nHerefordshire, until he came very nigh to Leominster; and they\ngathered against him, as well the landsmen as the Frenchmen of\nthe castle, and there were slain of the English very many good\nmen, and also of the Frenchmen; that was on the same day, on\nwhich, thirteen years before, Eadwine had been slain by his\ncompanions.))", "((A.D. 1052.  In this year died Elgive Emma, King Edward's mother\nand King Hardecanute's.  And in this same year, the king decreed,\nand his council, that ships should proceed to Sandwich; and they\nset Ralph, the earl, and Odda, the earl [Of Devon], as headmen\nthereto.  Then Godwin, the earl, went out from Bruges with his\nships to Ysendyck, and left it one day before Midsummer's-mass\neve, so that he came to Ness, which is south of Romney.  Then\ncame it to the knowledge of the earls out at Sandwich; and they\nthen went out after the other ships, and a land-force was ordered\nout against the ships.  Then during this, Godwin, the earl, was\nwarned, and then he went to Pevensey; and the weather was very\nsevere, so that the earls could not learn what was become of\nGodwin, the earl.  And then Godwin, the earl, went out again,\nuntil he came once more to Bruges; and the other ships returned\nagain to Sandwich.  And then it was decreed that the ships should\nreturn once more to London, and that other earls and commanders\nshould be appointed to the ships.  Then was it delayed so long\nthat the ship-force all departed, and all of them went home.\nWhen Godwin, the earl, learned that, then drew he up his sail,\nand his fleet, and then went west direct to the Isle of Wight,\nand there landed and ravaged so long there, until the people\nyielded them so much as they laid on them.  And then they went\nwestward until they came to Portland, and there they landed,\nand did whatsoever harm they were able to do.  Then was Harold\ncome out from Ireland with nine ships; and then landed at\nPorlock, and there much people was gathered against him; but he\nfailed not to procure himself provisions.  He proceeded further,\nand slew there a great number of the people, and took of cattle,\nand of men, and of property as it suited him.  He then went\neastward to his father; and then they both went eastward until\nthey came to the Isle of Wight, and there took that which was yet\nremaining for them.  And then they went thence to Pevensey and\ngot away thence as many ships as were there fit for service, and\nso onwards until he came to Ness, and got all the ships which\nwere in Romney, and in Hythe, and in Folkstone.  And then they\nwent east to Dover, and there landed, and there took ships and\nhostages, as many as they would, and so went to Sandwich and did\n\"hand\" the same; and everywhere hostages were given them, and\nprovisions wherever they desired.  And then they went to North-mouth,\nand so toward London; and some of the ships went within\nSheppey, and there did much harm, and went their way to King's\nMilton, and that they all burned, and betook themselves then\ntoward London after the earls.  When they came to London, there\nlay the king and all the earls there against them, with fifty\nships.  Then the earls sent to the king, and required of him,\nthat they might be held worthy of each of those things which\nhad been unjustly taken from them.  Then the king, however,\nresisted some while; so long as until the people who were with\nthe earl were much stirred against the king and against his\npeople, so that the earl himself with difficulty stilled the\npeople.  Then Bishop Stigand interposed with God's help, and the\nwise men as well within the town as without; and they decreed\nthat hostages should be set forth on either side: and thus was it\ndone.  When Archbishop Robert and the Frenchmen learned that,\nthey took their horses and went, some west to Pentecost's castle,\nsome north to Robert's castle.  And Archbishop Robert and Bishop\nUlf went out at East-gate, and their companions, and slew and\notherwise injured many young men, and went their way to direct\nEadulf's-ness; and he there put himself in a crazy ship, and went\ndirect over sea, and left his pall and all Christendom here on\nland, so as God would have it, inasmuch as he had before obtained\nthe dignity so as God would not have it.  Then there was a great\ncouncil proclaimed without London: and all the earls and the\nchief men who were in this land were at the council.  There\nGodwin bore forth his defence, and justified himself, before King\nEdward his lord, and before all people of the land, that he was\nguiltless of that which was laid against him, and against Harold\nhis son, and all his children.  And the king gave to the earl and\nhis children his full friendship, and full earldom, and all that\nhe before possessed, and to all the men who were with him.  And\nthe king gave to the lady [Editha] all that she before possessed.\nAnd they declared Archbishop Robert utterly an outlaw, and all\nthe Frenchmen, because they had made most of the difference\nbetween Godwin, the earl, and the king.  And Bishop Stigand\nobtained the Archbishopric of Canterbury.  In this same time\nArnwy, Abbot of Peterborough, left the abbacy, in sound health,\nand gave it to Leofric the monk, by leave of the king and of the\nmonks; and Abbot Arnwy lived afterwards eight years.  And Abbot\nLeofric then (enriched) the minster, so that it was called the\nGolden-borough.  Then it waxed greatly, in land, and in gold, and\nin silver.))", "((A.D. 1052.  And went so to the Isle of Wight, and there took\nall the ships which could be of any service, and hostages, and\nbetook himself so eastward.  And Harold had landed with nine\nships at Porlock, and slew there much people, and took cattle,\nand men, and property, and went his way eastward to his father,\nand they both went to Romney, to Hythe, to Folkstone, to Dover,\nto Sandwich, and ever they took all the ships which they found,\nwhich could be of any service, and hostages, all as they\nproceeded; and went then to London.))", "A.D. 1053.  About this time was the great wind, on the mass-night\nof St. Thomas; which did much harm everywhere.  And all the\nmidwinter also was much wind.  It was this year resolved to slay\nRees, the Welsh king's brother, because he did harm; and they\nbrought his head to Gloucester on the eve of Twelfth-day.  In\nthis same year, before Allhallowmas, died Wulfsy, Bishop of\nLichfield; and Godwin, Abbot of Winchcomb; and Aylward, Abbot of\nGlastonbury; all within one month.  And Leofwine, Abbot of\nCoventry, took to the bishopric at Lichfield; Bishop Aldred to\nthe abbacy at Winchcomb; and Aylnoth took to the abbacy at\nGlastonbury.  The same year died Elfric, brother of Odda, at\nDeerhurst; and his body resteth at Pershore.  In this year was\nthe king at Winchester, at Easter; and Earl Godwin with him, and\nEarl Harold his son, and Tosty.  On the day after Easter sat he\nwith the king at table; when he suddenly sunk beneath against the\nfoot-rail, deprived of speech and of all his strength.  He was\nbrought into the king's chamber; and they supposed that it would\npass over: but it was not so.  He continued thus speechless and\nhelpless till the Thursday; when he resigned his life, on the\nseventeenth before the calends of May; and he was buried at\nWinchester in the old minster.  Earl Harold, his son, took to the\nearldom that his father had before, and to all that his father\npossessed; whilst Earl Elgar took to the earldom that Harold had\nbefore.  The Welshmen this year slew a great many of the warders\nof the English people at Westbury.  This year there was no\narchbishop in this land: but Bishop Stigand held the see of\nCanterbury at Christ church, and Kinsey that of York.  Leofwine\nand Wulfwy went over sea, and had themselves consecrated bishops\nthere.  Wulfwy took to the bishopric which Ulf had whilst he was\nliving and in exile.", "((A.D. 1053.

And the same year, before All Hallows-mass,\ndied Wulfsy, Bishop of Lichfield, and Godwin, Abbot of Winchcomb,\nand Egelward, Abbot of Clastonbury, all within one month, and\nLeofwine succeeded to the Bishopric of Lichfield, and Bishop\nAidred [Of Worcester] took the abbacy at Winchcomb, and Egelnoth\nsucceeded to the abbacy at Glastonbury.

This year died Leo the holy pope, at Rome: and Victor\nwas chosen pope in his stead.  And in this year was so great loss\nof cattle as was not remembered for many winters before.  This\nyear went Earl Siward with a large army against Scotland,\nconsisting both of marines and landforces; and engaging with the\nScots, he put to flight the King Macbeth; slew all the best in\nthe land; and led thence much spoil, such as no man before\nobtained.  Many fell also on his side, both Danish and English;\neven his own son, Osborn, and his sister's son, Sihward: and many\nof his house-carls, and also of the king's, were there slain that\nday, which was that of the Seven Sleepers.  This same year went\nBishop Aldred south over sea into Saxony, to Cologne, on the\nking's errand; where he was entertained with great respect by the\nemperor, abode there well-nigh a year, and received presents not\nonly from the court, but from the Bishop of Cologne and the\nemperor.  He commissioned Bishop Leofwine to consecrate the\nminster at Evesham; and it was consecrated in the same year, on\nthe sixth before the ides of October.  This year also died Osgod\nClapa suddenly in his bed, as he lay at rest.", "((A.D. 1054.  This year went Siward the earl with a great army\ninto Scotland, both with a ship-force and with a landforce, and\nfought against the Scots, and put to flight King Macbeth, and\nslew all who were the chief men in the land, and led thence much\nbooty, such as no man before had obtained.  But his son Osborn,\nand his sister's son Siward, and some of his house-carls, and\nalso of the king's, were there slain, on the day of the Seven\nSleepers.  The same year went Bishop Aldred to Cologne, over sea,\non the king's errand; and he was there received with much worship\nby the emperor [Henry III], and there he dwelt well nigh a year;\nand either gave him entertainment, both the Bishop of Cologne and\nthe emperor.  And he gave leave to Bishop Leofwine [Of Lichfield]\nto consecrate the minster at Evesham on the sixth before the ides\nof October.  In this year died Osgod suddenly in his bed.  And\nthis year died St. Leo the pope; and Victor was chosen pope in\nhis stead.))", "A.D. 1055.  This year died Earl Siward at York; and his body lies\nwithin the minster at Galmanho, (76) which he had himself ordered\nto be built and consecrated, in the name of God and St. Olave, to\nthe honour of God and to all his saints.  Archbishop Kinsey\nfetched his pall from Pope Victor.  Then, within a little time\nafter, a general council was summoned in London, seven nights\nbefore mid-Lent; at which Earl Elgar, son of Earl Leofric, was\noutlawed almost without any guilt; because it was said against\nhim that he was the betrayer of the king and of all the people of\nthe land.  And he was arraigned thereof before all that were\nthere assembled, though the crime laid to his charge was\nunintentional.  The king, however, gave the earldom, which Earl\nSiward formerly had, to Tosty, son of Earl Godwin.  Whereupon\nEarl Elgar sought Griffin's territory in North-Wales; whence he\nwent to Ireland, and there gave him a fleet of eighteen ships,\nbesides his own; and then returned to Wales to King Griffin with\nthe armament, who received him on terms of amity.  And they\ngathered a great force with the Irishmen and the Welsh: and Earl\nRalph collected a great army against them at the town of\nHereford; where they met; but ere there was a spear thrown the\nEnglish people fled, because they were on horses.  The enemy then\nmade a great slaughter there--about four hundred or five\nhundred men; they on the other side none.  They went then to the\ntown, and burned it utterly; and the large minster (77) also\nwhich the worthy Bishop Athelstan had caused to be built, that\nthey plundered and bereft of relic and of reef, and of all things\nwhatever; and the people they slew, and led some away.  Then an\narmy from all parts of England was gathered very nigh; (78) and\nthey came to Gloucester: whence they sallied not far out against\nthe Welsh, and there lay some time.  And Earl Harold caused the\ndike to be dug about the town the while.  Meantime men began to\nspeak of peace; and Earl Harold and those who were with him came\nto Bilsley, where amity and friendship were established between\nthem.  The sentence of outlawry against Earl Elgar was reversed;\nand they gave him all that was taken from him before.  The fleet\nreturned to Chester, and there awaited their pay, which Elgar\npromised them.  The slaughter was on the ninth before the calends\nof November.  In the same year died Tremerig, the Welsh bishop,\nsoon after the plundering; who was Bishop Athelstan's substitute,\nafter he became infirm.", "((A.D. 1055.  In this year died Siward the earl at York, and he\nlies at Galmanho, in the minster which himself caused to be\nbuilt, and consecrated in God's and Olave's name.  And Tosty\nsucceeded to the earldom which he had held.  And Archbishop\nKynsey [Of York], fetched his pall from Pope Victor.  And soon\nthereafter was outlawed Elgar the earl, son of Leofric the earl,\nwell-nigh without guilt.  But he went to Ireland and to Wales,\nand procured himself there a great force, and so went to\nHereford: but there came against him Ralph the earl, with a large\narmy, and with a slight conflict he put them to flight, and much\npeople slew in the flight: and they went then into Hereford-port,\nand that they ravaged, and burned the great minster which Bishop\nAthelstan had built, and slew the priests within the minster, and\nmany in addition thereto, and took all the treasures therein, and\ncarried them away with them.  And when they had done the utmost\nevil, this counsel was counselled: that Elgar the earl should be\ninlawed, and be given his earldom, and all that had been taken\nfrom him.  This ravaging happened on the 9th before the Kalends\nof November.  In the same year died Tremerin the Welsh bishop [Of\nSt. David's] soon after that ravaging: and he was Bishop\nAthelstan's coadjutor from the time that he had become infirm.))", "((A.D. 1055.  In this year died Siward the earl: and then was\nsummoned a general council, seven days before Mid-lent; and they\noutlawed Elgar the earl, because it was cast upon him that he was\na traitor to the king and to all the people of the land.  And he\nmade a confession of it before all the men who were there\ngathered; though the word escaped him unintentionally.  And the\nking gave the earldom to Tosty, son of Earl Godwin, which Siward\nthe earl before held.  And Elgar the earl sought Griffin's\nprotection in North-Wales.  And in this year Griffin and Elgar\nburned St. Ethelbert's minster, and all the town of Hereford.))", "A.D. 1056.  This year Bishop Egelric resigned his bishopric at\nDurham, and retired to Peterborough minster; and his brother\nEgelwine succeeded him.  The worthy Bishop Athelstan died on the\nfourth before the ides of February; and his body lies at\nHereford.  To him succeeded Leofgar, who was Earl Harold's\nmass-priest.  He wore his knapsack in his priesthood, until he was a\nbishop.  He abandoned his chrism and his rood--his ghostly\nweapons--and took to his spear and to his sword, after his\nbishophood; and so marched to the field against Griffin the Welsh\nking. (79)  But he was there slain, and his priests with him, and\nElnoth the sheriff, and many other good men with them; and the\nrest fled.  This was eight nights before midsummer.  Difficult is\nit to relate all the vexation and the journeying, the marching\nand the fatigue, the fall of men, and of horses also, which the\nwhole army of the English suffered, until Earl Leofric, and Earl\nHarold, and Bishop Eldred, came together and made peace between\nthem; so that Griffin swore oaths, that he would be a firm and\nfaithful viceroy to King Edward.  Then Bishop Eldred took to the\nbishopric which Leofgar had before eleven weeks and four days.\nThe same year died Cona the emperor; and Earl Odda, whose body\nlies at Pershore, and who was admitted a monk before his end;\nwhich was on the second before the calends of September; a good\nman and virtuous and truly noble.", "A.D. 1057.  This year came Edward Etheling, son of King Edmund,\nto this land, and soon after died.  His body is buried within St.\nPaul's minster at London.  He was brother's son to King Edward.\nKing Edmund was called Ironside for his valour.  This etheling\nKing Knute had sent into Hungary, to betray him; but he there\ngrew in favour with good men, as God granted him, and it well\nbecame him; so that he obtained the emperor's cousin in marriage,\nand by her had a fair offspring.  Her name was Agatha.  We know\nnot for what reason it was done, that he should see his relation,\nKing Edward.  Alas!  that was a rueful time, and injurious to all\nthis nation--that he ended his life so soon after he came to\nEngland, to the misfortune of this miserable people.  The same\nyear died Earl Leofric, on the second before the calends of\nOctober; who was very wise before God, and also before the world;\nand who benefited all this nation. (80)  He lies at Coventry\n(81): and his son Elgar took to his territory.  This year died\nEarl Ralph, on the twelfth before the calends of January; and\nlies at Peterborough.  Also died Bishop Heca, in Sussex; and\nEgelric was elevated to his see.  This year also died Pope\nVictor; and Stephen was chosen pope, who was Abbot of Monut\nCassino.", "((A.D. 1057.

This year was Earl Elgar banished: but he soon came\nin again by force, through Griffin's assistance: and a naval\narmament came from Norway.  It is tedious to tell how it all fell\nout.  In this same year Bishop Aldred consecrated the minster\nchurch at Gloucester, which he himself had raised (82) to the\nhonour of God and St. Peter; and then went to Jerusalem (83) with\nsuch dignity as no other man did before him, and betook himself\nthere to God.  A worthy gift he also offered to our Lord's\nsepulchre; which was a golden chalice of the value of five marks,\nof very wonderful workmanship.  In the same year died Pope\nStephen; and Benedict was appointed pope.  He sent hither the\npall to Bishop Stigand; who as archbishop consecrated Egelric a\nmonk at Christ church, Bishop of Sussex; and Abbot Siward Bishop\nof Rochester.", "((A.D. 1058.

This year was a great earthquake on the Translation\nof St. Martin, and King Henry died in France.

Pope Nicholas also died; and Alexander was\nchosen pope, who was Bishop of Lucca.

This year went Earl Harold, after mid-winter, from\nGloucester to Rhyddlan; which belonged to Griffin: and that\nhabitation he burned, with his ships and all the rigging\nbelonging thereto; and put him to flight.  Then in the gang-days\nwent Harold with his ships from Bristol about Wales; where he\nmade a truce with the people, and they gave him hostages.  Tosty\nmeanwhile advanced with a land-force against them, and plundered\nthe land.  But in the harvest of the same year was King Griffin\nslain, on the nones of August, by his own men, through the war\nthat he waged with Earl Harold.  He was king over all the Welsh\nnation.  And his head was brought to Earl Harold; who sent it to\nthe king, with his ship's head, and the rigging therewith.  King\nEdward committed the land to his two brothers, Blethgent and\nRigwatle; who swore oaths, and gave hostages to the king and to\nthe earl, that they would be faithful to him in all things, ready\nto aid him everywhere by water and land, and would pay him such\ntribute from the land as was paid long before to other kings.", "((A.D. 1063.  This year went Harold the earl, and his brother\nTosty the earl, as well with a land-force as a shipforce, into\nWales, and they subdued the land; and the people delivered\nhostages to them, and submitted; and went afterwards and slew\ntheir King Griffin, and brought to Harold his head: and he\nappointed another king thereto.))", "A.D. 1065.  This year, before Lammas, ordered Earl Harold his men\nto build at Portskeweth in Wales.  But when he had begun, and\ncollected many materials, and thought to have King Edward there\nfor the purpose of hunting, even when it was all ready, came\nCaradoc, son of Griffin, with all the gang that he could get, and\nslew almost all that were building there; and they seized the\nmaterials that were there got ready.  Wist we not who first\nadvised the wicked deed.  This was done on the mass-day of St.\nBartholomew.  Soon after this all the thanes in Yorkshire and in\nNorthumberland gathered themselves together at York, and outlawed\ntheir Earl Tosty; slaying all the men of his clan that they could\nreach, both Danish and English; and took all his weapons in York,\nwith gold and silver, and all his money that they could anywhere\nthere find.  They then sent after Morkar, son of Earl Elgar, and\nchose him for their earl.  He went south with all the shire, and\nwith Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, till he\ncame to Northampton; where his brother Edwin came to meet him\nwith the men that were in his earldom.  Many Britons also came\nwith him.  Harold also there met them; on whom they imposed an\nerrand to King Edward, sending also messengers with him, and\nrequesting that they might have Morcar for their earl.  This the\nking granted; and sent back Harold to them, to Northampton, on\nthe eve of St. Simon and St. Jude; and announced to them the\nsame, and confirmed it by hand, and renewed there the laws of\nKnute.  But the Northern men did much harm about Northampton,\nwhilst he went on their errand: either that they slew men, and\nburned houses and corn; or took all the cattle that they could\ncome at; which amounted to many thousands.  Many hundred men also\nthey took, and led northward with them; so that not only that\nshire, but others near it were the worse for many winters.  Then\nEarl Tosty and his wife, and all they who acted with him, went\nsouth over sea with him to Earl Baldwin; who received them all:\nand they were there all the winter.  About midwinter King Edward\ncame to Westminster, and had the minster there consecrated, which\nhe had himself built to the honour of God, and St. Peter, and all\nGod's saints.  This church-hallowing was on Childermas-day.  He\ndied on the eve of twelfth-day; and he was buried on twelfth-day\nin the same minster; as it is hereafter said.\n          Here Edward king, (86)\n          of Angles lord,\n          sent his stedfast\n          soul to Christ.\n          In the kingdom of God\n          a holy spirit!\n          He in the world here\n          abode awhile,\n          in the kingly throng\n          of council sage.\n          Four and twenty\n          winters wielding\n          the sceptre freely,\n          wealth he dispensed.\n          In the tide of health,\n          the youthful monarch,\n          offspring of Ethelred!\n          ruled well his subjects;\n          the Welsh and the Scots,\n          and the Britons also,\n          Angles and Saxons\n          relations of old.\n          So apprehend\n          the first in rank,\n          that to Edward all\n          the noble king\n          were firmly held\n          high-seated men.\n          Blithe-minded aye\n          was the harmless king;\n          though he long ere,\n          of land bereft,\n          abode in exile\n          wide on the earth;\n          when Knute o'ercame\n          the kin of Ethelred,\n          and the Danes wielded\n          the dear kingdom\n          of Engle-land.\n          Eight and twenty\n          winters' rounds\n          they wealth dispensed.\n          Then came forth\n          free in his chambers,\n          in royal array,\n          good, pure, and mild,\n          Edward the noble;\n          by his country defended--\n          by land and people.\n          Until suddenly came\n          the bitter Death\n          and this king so dear\n          snatched from the earth.\n          Angels carried\n          his soul sincere\n          into the light of heaven.\n          But the prudent king\n          had settled the realm\n          on high-born men--\n          on Harold himself,\n          the noble earl;\n          who in every season\n          faithfully heard\n          and obeyed his lord,\n          in word and deed;\n          nor gave to any\n          what might be wanted\n          by the nation's king.\nThis year also was Earl Harold hallowed to king; but he enjoyed\nlittle tranquillity therein the while that he wielded the\nkingdom.", "((A.D. 1065.  And the man-slaying was on St. Bartholomew's\nmass-day.  And then, after Michael's-mass, all the thanes in\nYorkshire went to York, and there slew all Earl Tosty's household\nservants whom they might hear of, and took his treasures: and\nTosty was then at Britford with the king.  And then, very soon\nthereafter, was a great council at Northampton; and then at\nOxford on the day of Simon and Jude.  And there was Harold the\nearl, and would work their reconciliation if he might, but he\ncould not: but all his earldom him unanimously forsook and\noutlawed, and all who with him lawlessness upheld, because he\nrobbed God first, and all those bereaved over whom he had power\nof life and of land.  And they then took to themselves Morkar for\nearl; and Tosty went then over sea, and his wife with him, to\nBaldwin's land, and they took up their winter residence at St.\nOmer's.))", "A.D. 1066.  This year came King Harold from York to Westminster,\non the Easter succeeding the midwinter when the king (Edward)\ndied.  Easter was then on the sixteenth day before the calends of\nMay.  Then was over all England such a token seen as no man ever\nsaw before.  Some men said that it was the comet-star, which\nothers denominate the long-hair'd star.  It appeared first on the\neve called \"Litania major\", that is, on the eighth before the\ncalends off May; and so shone all the week.  Soon after this came\nin Earl Tosty from beyond sea into the Isle of Wight, with as\nlarge a fleet as he could get; and he was there supplied with\nmoney and provisions.  Thence he proceeded, and committed\noutrages everywhere by the sea-coast where he could land, until\nhe came to Sandwich.  When it was told King Harold, who was in\nLondon, that his brother Tosty was come to Sandwich, he gathered\nso large a force, naval and military, as no king before collected\nin this land; for it was credibly reported that Earl William from\nNormandy, King Edward's cousin, would come hither and gain this\nland; just as it afterwards happened.  When Tosty understood that\nKing Harold was on the way to Sandwich, he departed thence, and\ntook some of the boatmen with him, willing and unwilling, and\nwent north into the Humber with sixty skips; whence he plundered\nin Lindsey, and there slew many good men.  When the Earls Edwin\nand Morkar understood that, they came hither, and drove him from\nthe land.  And the boatmen forsook him.  Then he went to Scotland\nwith twelve smacks; and the king of the Scots entertained him,\nand aided him with provisions; and he abode there all the summer.\nThere met him Harold, King of Norway, with three hundred ships.\nAnd Tosty submitted to him, and became his man. (87)  Then came\nKing Harold (88) to Sandwich, where he awaited his fleet; for it\nwas long ere it could be collected: but when it was assembled, he\nwent into the Isle of Wight, and there lay all the summer and the\nautumn.  There was also a land-force every where by the sea,\nthough it availed nought in the end.  It was now the nativity of\nSt. Mary, when the provisioning of the men began; and no man\ncould keep them there any longer.  They therefore had leave to go\nhome: and the king rode up, and the ships were driven to London;\nbut many perished ere they came thither.  When the ships were\ncome home, then came Harald, King of Norway, north into the Tine,\nunawares, with a very great sea-force--no small one; that might\nbe, with three hundred ships or more; and Earl Tosty came to him\nwith all those that he had got; just as they had before said: and\nthey both then went up with all the fleet along the Ouse toward\nYork. (89)  When it was told King Harold in the south, after he\nhad come from the ships, that Harald, King of Norway, and Earl\nTosty were come up near York, then went he northward by day and\nnight, as soon as he could collect his army.  But, ere King\nHarold could come thither, the Earls Edwin and Morkar had\ngathered from their earldoms as great a force as they could get,\nand fought with the enemy. (90)  They made a great slaughter too;\nbut there was a good number of the English people slain, and\ndrowned, and put to flight: and the Northmen had possession of\nthe field of battle.  It was then told Harold, king of the\nEnglish, that this had thus happened.  And this fight was on the\neve of St. Matthew the apostle, which was Wednesday.  Then after\nthe fight went Harold, King of Norway, and Earl Tosty into York\nwith as many followers as they thought fit; and having procured\nhostages and provisions from the city, they proceeded to their\nships, and proclaimed full friendship, on condition that all\nwould go southward with them, and gain this land.  In the midst\nof this came Harold, king of the English, with all his army, on\nthe Sunday, to Tadcaster; where he collected his fleet.  Thence\nhe proceeded on Monday throughout York.  But Harald, King of\nNorway, and Earl Tosty, with their forces, were gone from their\nships beyond York to Stanfordbridge; for that it was given them\nto understand, that hostages would be brought to them there from\nall the shire.  Thither came Harold, king of the English,\nunawares against them beyond the bridge; and they closed together\nthere, and continued long in the day fighting very severely.\nThere was slain Harald the Fair-hair'd, King of Norway, and Earl\nTosty, and a multitude of people with them, both of Normans and\nEnglish; (91) and the Normans that were left fled from the\nEnglish, who slew them hotly behind; until some came to their\nships, some were drowned, some burned to death, and thus\nvariously destroyed; so that there was little left: and the\nEnglish gained possession of the field.  But there was one of the\nNorwegians who withstood the English folk, so that they could not\npass over the bridge, nor complete the victory.  An Englishman\naimed at him with a javelin, but it availed nothing.  Then came\nanother under the bridge, who pierced him terribly inwards under\nthe coat of mail.  And Harold, king of the English, then came\nover the bridge, followed by his army; and there they made a\ngreat slaughter, both of the Norwegians and of the Flemings.  But\nHarold let the king's son, Edmund, go home to Norway with all the\nships.  He also gave quarter to Olave, the Norwegian king's son,\nand to their bishop, and to the earl of the Orkneys, and to all\nthose that were left in the ships; who then went up to our king,\nand took oaths that they would ever maintain faith and friendship\nunto this land.  Whereupon the King let them go home with twenty-four\nships.  These two general battles were fought within five\nnights.  Meantime Earl William came up from Normandy into\nPevensey on the eve of St. Michael's mass; and soon after his\nlanding was effected, they constructed a castle at the port of\nHastings.  This was then told to King Harold; and he gathered a\nlarge force, and came to meet him at the estuary of Appledore.\nWilliam, however, came against him unawares, ere his army was\ncollected; but the king, nevertheless, very hardly encountered\nhim with the men that would support him: and there was a great\nslaughter made on either side.  There was slain King Harold, and\nLeofwin his brother, and Earl Girth his brother, with many good\nmen: and the Frenchmen gained the field of battle, as God granted\nthem for the sins of the nation.  Archbishop Aldred and the\ncorporation of London were then desirous of having child Edgar to\nking, as he was quite natural to them; and Edwin and Morkar\npromised them that they would fight with them.  But the more\nprompt the business should ever be, so was it from day to day the\nlater and worse; as in the end it all fared.  This battle was\nfought on the day of Pope Calixtus: and Earl William returned to\nHastings, and waited there to know whether the people would\nsubmit to him.  But when he found that they would not come to\nhim, he went up with all his force that was left and that came\nsince to him from over sea, and ravaged all the country that he\noverran, until he came to Berkhampstead; where Archbishop Aldred\ncame to meet him, with child Edgar, and Earls Edwin and Morkar,\nand all the best men from London; who submitted then for need,\nwhen the most harm was done.  It was very ill-advised that they\ndid not so before, seeing that God would not better things for\nour sins.  And they gave him hostages and took oaths: and he\npromised them that he would be a faithful lord to them; though in\nthe midst of this they plundered wherever they went.  Then on\nmidwinter's day Archbishop Aldred hallowed him to king at\nWestminster, and gave him possession with the books of Christ,\nand also swore him, ere that he would set the crown on his head,\nthat he would so well govern this nation as any before him best\ndid, if they would be faithful to him.  Neverrhetess he laid very\nheavy tribute on men, and in Lent went over sea to Normandy,\ntaking with him Archbishop Stigand, and Abbot Aylnoth of\nGlastonbury, and the child Edgar, and the Earls Edwin, Morkar,\nand Waltheof, and many other good men of England.  Bishop Odo and\nEarl William lived here afterwards, and wrought castles widely\nthrough this country, and harassed the miserable people; and ever\nsince has evil increased very much.  May the end be good, when\nGod will!  In that same expedition (92) was Leofric, Abbot of\nPeterborough; who sickened there, and came home, and died soon\nafter, on the night of Allhallow-mass.  God honour his soul!  In\nhis day was all bliss and all good at Peterborough.  He was\nbeloved by all; so that the king gave to St. Peter and him the\nabbey at Burton, and that at Coventry, which the Earl Leofric,\nwho was his uncle, had formerly made; with that of Croyland, and\nthat of Thorney.  He did so much good to the minster of\nPeterborough, in gold, and in silver, and in shroud, and in land,\nas no other ever did before him, nor any one after him.  But now\nwas Gilden-borough become a wretched borough.  The monks then\nchose for abbot Provost Brand, because he was a very good man,\nand very wise; and sent him to Edgar Etheling, for that the\nland-folk supposed that he should be king: and the etheling\nreceived him gladly.  When King William heard say that, he was\nvery wroth, and said that the abbot had renounced him: but good\nmen went between them, and reconciled them; because the abbot was\na good man.  He gave the king forty marks of gold for his\nreconciliation; and he lived but a little while after--only\nthree years.  Afterwards came all wretchedness and all evil to\nthe minster.  God have mercy on it!", "((A.D. 1066.  This year died King Edward, and Harold the earl\nsucceeded to the kingdom, and held it forty weeks and one day.\nAnd this year came William, and won England.  And in this year\nChrist-Church [Canterbury] was burned.  And this year appeared a\ncomet on the fourteenth before the kalends of May.))", "((A.D. 1066.  ...And then he [Tosty] went thence, and did harm\neverywhere by the sea-coast where he could land, as far as\nSandwich.  Then was it made known to King Harold, who was in\nLondon, that Tosty his brother was come to Sandwich.  Then\ngathered he so great a ship-force, and also a land force, as no\nking here in the land had before gathered, because it had been\nsoothly said unto him, that William the earl from Normandy, King\nEdward's kinsman, would come hither and subdue this land: all as\nit afterwards happened.  When Tosty learned that King Harold was\non his way to Sandwich, then went he from Sandwich, and took some\nof the boatmen with him, some willingly and some unwillingly; and\nwent then north into Humber, and there ravaged in Lindsey, and\nthere slew many good men.  When Edwin the earl and Morcar the\nearl understood that, then came they thither, and drove him out\nof the land.  And he went then to Scotland: and the king of Scots\nprotected him, and assisted him with provisions; and he there\nabode all the summer.  Then came King Harold to Sandwich, and\nthere awaited his fleet, because it was long before it could be\ngathered together.  And when his fleet was gathered together,\nthen went he into the Isle of Wight, and there lay all the summer\nand the harvest; and a land-force was kept everywhere by the sea,\nthough in the end it was of no benefit.  When it was the Nativity\nof St. Mary, then were the men's provisions gone, and no man\ncould any longer keep them there.  Then were the men allowed to\ngo home, and the king rode up, and the ships were dispatched to\nLondon; and many perished before they came thither.  When the\nships had reached home, then came King Harald from Norway, north\ninto Tyne, and unawares, with a very large ship-force, and no\nsmall one; that might be, or more.  And Tosty the earl came to\nhim with all that he had gotten, all as they had before agreed;\nand then they went both, with all the fleet, along the Ouse, up\ntowards York.  Then was it made known to King Harold in the\nsouth, as he was come from on ship-board, that Harald King of\nNorway and Tosty the earl were landed near York.  Then went he\nnorthward, day and night, as quickly as he could gather his\nforces.  Then, before that King Harold could come thither, then\ngathered Edwin the earl and Morcar the earl from their earldom\nas great a force as they could get together; and they fought\nagainst the army, and made great slaughter: and there was much of\nthe English people slain, and drowned, and driven away in flight;\nand the Northmen had possession of the place of carnage.  And\nthis fight was on the vigil of St. Matthew the apostle, and it\nwas Wednesday.  And then, after the fight, went Harald, King of\nNorway, and Tosty the earl, into York, with as much people as\nseemed meet to them.  And they delivered hostages to them from\nthe city, and also assisted them with provisions; and so they\nwent thence to their ships, and they agreed upon a full peace, so\nthat they should all go with him south, and this land subdue.\nThen, during this, came Harold, king of the Angles, with all his\nforces, on the Sunday, to Tadcaster, and there drew up his force,\nand went then on Monday throughout York; and Harald, King of\nNorway, and Tosty the earl, and their forces, were gone from\ntheir ships beyond York to Stanfordbridge, because it had been\npromised them for a certainty, that there, from all the shire,\nhostages should be brought to meet them.  Then came Harold, king\nof the English, against them, unawares, beyond the bridge, and\nthey there joined battle, and very strenuously, for a long time\nof the day, continued fighting: and there was Harald, King of\nNorway, and Tosty the earl slain, and numberless of the people\nwith them, as well of the Northmen as of the English: and the\nNorthmen fled from the English.  Then was there one of the\nNorwegians who withstood the English people, so that they might\nnot pass over the bridge, nor obtain the victory.  Then an\nEnglishman aimed at him with a javelin, but availed nothing; and\nthen came another under the bridge, and pierced him terribly\ninwards under the coat of mail.  Then came Harold, king of the\nEnglish, over the bridge, and his forces onward with him, and\nthere made great slaughter, as well of Norwegians as of Flemings.\nAnd the King's son, Edmund, Harold let go home to Norway, with\nall the ships.))", "((A.D. 1066.  In this year was consecrated the minster at\nWestminster, on Childer-mass-day.  And King Edward died on the\neve of Twelfth-day; and he was buried on Twelfth-day within the\nnewly consecrated church at Westminster.  And Harold the earl\nsucceeded to the kingdom of England, even as the king had granted\nit to him, and men also had chosen him thereto; and he was\ncrowned as king on Twelfth-day.  And that same year that he\nbecame king, he went out with a fleet against William [Earl of\nNormandy]; and the while, came Tosty the earl into Humber with\nsixty ships.  Edwin the earl came with a land-force and drove him\nout; and the boatmen forsook him.  And he went to Scotland with\ntwelve vessels; and Harald, the King of Norway, met him with\nthree hundred ships, and Tosty submitted to him; and they both\nwent into Humber, until they came to York.  And Morcar the earl,\nand Edwin the earl, fought against them; and the king of the\nNorwegians had the victory.  And it was made known to King Harold\nhow it there was done, and had happened; and he came there with a\ngreat army of English men, and met him at Stanfordbridge, and\nslew him and the earl Tosty, and boldly overcame all the army.\nAnd the while, William the earl landed at Hastings, on St.\nMichael's-day: and Harold came from the north, and fought against\nhim before all his army had come up: and there he fell, and his\ntwo brothers, Girth and Leofwin; and William subdued this land.\nAnd he came to Westminster, and Archbishop Aldred consecrated him\nking, and men paid him tribute, delivered him hostages, and\nafterwards bought their land.  And then was Leofric, Abbot of\nPeterborough, in that same expedition; and there he sickened, and\ncame home, and was dead soon thereafter, on All-hallows-mass-night;\nGod be merciful to his soul!  In his day was all bliss and\nall good in Peterborough; and he was dear to all people, so that\nthe king gave to St. Peter and to him the abbacy at Burton, and\nthat of Coventry, which Leofric the earl, who was his uncle,\nbefore had made, and that of Crowland, and that of Thorney.  And\nhe conferred so much of good upon the minster of Peterborough, in\ngold, and in silver, and in vestments, and in land, as never any\nother did before him, nor any after him.  After, Golden-borough\nbecame a wretched borough.  Then chose the monks for abbot Brand\nthe provost, by reason that he was a very good man, and very\nwise, and sent him then to Edgar the etheling, by reason that the\npeople of the land supposed that he should become king: and the\netheling granted it him then gladly.  When King William heard say\nthat, then was he very wroth, and said that the abbot had\ndespised him.  Then went good men between them, and reconciled\nthem, by reason that the abbot was a good man.  Then gave he the\nking forty marks of gold for a reconciliation; and then\nthereafter, lived he a little while, but three years.  After that\ncame every tribulation and every evil to the minster.  God have\nmercy on it!))", "A.D. 1067.  This year came the king back again to England on St.\nNicholas's day; and the same day was burned the church of Christ\nat Canterbury.  Bishop Wulfwy also died, and is buried at his see\nin Dorchester.  The child Edric and the Britons were unsettled\nthis year, and fought with the castlemen at Hereford, and did\nthem much harm.  The king this year imposed a heavy guild on the\nwretched people; but, notwithstanding, let his men always plunder\nall the country that they went over; and then he marched to\nDevonshire, and beset the city of Exeter eighteen days.  There\nwere many of his army slain; out he had promised them well, and\nperformed ill; and the citizens surrendered the city because the\nthanes had betrayed them.  This summer the child Edgar departed,\nwith his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, Margaret and\nChristina, and Merle-Sweyne, and many good men with them; and\ncame to Scotland under the protection of King Malcolm, who\nentertained them all.  Then began King Malcolm to yearn after the\nchild's sister, Margaret, to wife; but he and all his men long\nrefused; and she also herself was averse, and said that she would\nneither have him nor any one else, if the Supreme Power would\ngrant, that she in her maidenhood might please the mighty Lord\nwith a carnal heart, in this short life, in pure continence.  The\nking, however, earnestly urged her brother, until he answered\nYea.  And indeed he durst not otherwise; for they were come into\nhis kingdom.  So that then it was fulfilled, as God had long ere\nforeshowed; and else it could not be; as he himself saith in his\ngospel: that \"not even a sparrow on the ground may fall, without\nhis foreshowing.\"  The prescient Creator wist long before what he\nof her would have done; for that she should increase the glory of\nGod in this land, lead the king aright from the path of error,\nbend him and his people together to a better way, and suppress\nthe bad customs which the nation formerly followed: all which she\nafterwards did.  The king therefore received her, though it was\nagainst her will, and was pleased with her manners, and thanked\nGod, who in his might had given him such a match.  He wisely\nbethought himself, as he was a prudent man, and turned himself to\nGod, and renounced all impurity; accordingly, as the apostle\nPaul, the teacher of all the gentries, saith: \"Salvabitur vir\ninfidelis per mulierem fidelem; sic et mulier infidelis per virum\nfidelem,\" etc.: that is in our language, \"Full oft the\nunbelieving husband is sanctified and healed through the\nbelieving wife, and so belike the wife through the believing\nhusband.\"  This queen aforesaid performed afterwards many useful\ndeeds in this land to the glory of God, and also in her royal\nestate she well conducted herself, as her nature was.  Of a\nfaithful and noble kin was she sprung.  Her father was Edward\nEtheling, son of King Edmund.  Edmund was the son of Ethelred;\nEthelred the son of Edgar; Edgar the son of Edred; and so forth\nin that royal line: and her maternal kindred goeth to the Emperor\nHenry, who had the sovereignty over Rome.  This year went out\nGitha, Harold's mother, and the wives of many good men with her,\nto the Flat-Holm, and there abode some time; and so departed\nthence over sea to St. Omer's.  This Easter came the king to\nWinchester; and Easter was then on the tenth before the calends\nof April.  Soon after this came the Lady Matilda hither to this\nland; and Archbishop Eldred hallowed her to queen at Westminster\non Whit Sunday.  Then it was told the king, that the people in\nthe North had gathered themselves together, and would stand\nagainst him if he came.  Whereupon he went to Nottingham, and\nwrought there a castle; and so advanced to York, and there\nwrought two castles; and the same at Lincoln, and everywhere in\nthat quarter.  Then Earl Gospatric and the best men went into\nScotland.  Amidst this came one of Harold's sons from Ireland\nwith a naval force into the mouth of the Avon unawares, and\nplundered soon over all that quarter; whence they went to\nBristol, and would have stormed the town; but the people bravely\nwithstood them.  When they could gain nothing from the town, they\nwent to their ships with the booty which they had acquired by\nplunder; and then they advanced upon Somersetshire, and there\nwent up; and Ednoth, master of the horse, fought with them; but\nhe was there slain, and many good men on either side; and those\nthat were left departed thence.", "A.D. 1068.  This year King William gave Earl Robert the earldom\nover Northumberland; but the landsmen attacked him in the town of\nDurham, and slew him, and nine hundred men with him.  Soon\nafterwards Edgar Etheling came with all the Northumbrians to\nYork; and the townsmen made a treaty with him: but King William\ncame from the South unawares on them with a large army, and put\nthem to flight, and slew on the spot those who could not escape;\nwhich were many hundred men; and plundered the town.  St. Peter's\nminster he made a profanation, and all other places also he\ndespoiled and trampled upon; and the etheling went back again to\nScotland.  After this came Harold's sons from Ireland, about\nmidsummer, with sixty-four ships into the mouth of the Taft,\nwhere they unwarily landed: and Earl Breon came unawares against\nthem with a large army, and fought with them, and slew there all\nthe best men that were in the fleet; and the others, being small\nforces, escaped to the ships: and Harold's sons went back to\nIreland again.", "A.D. 1069.  This year died Aldred, Archbishop of York; and he is\nthere buried, at his see.  He died on the day of Protus and\nHyacinthus, having held the see with much dignity ten years\nwanting only fifteen weeks.  Soon after this came from Denmark\nthree of the sons of King Sweyne with two hundred and forty\nships, together with Earl Esborn and Earl Thurkill, into the\nHumber; where they were met by the child Edgar, and Earl\nWaltheof, and Merle-Sweyne, and Earl Gospatric with the\nNorthumbrians, and all the landsmen; riding and marching full\nmerrily with an immense army: and so all unanimously advanced to\nYork; where they stormed and demolished the castle, and won\ninnumerable treasures therein; slew there many hundreds of\nFrenchmen, and led many with them to the ships; but, ere that the\nshipmen came thither, the Frenchmen had burned the city, and also\nthe holy minster of St. Peter had they entirely plundered, and\ndestroyed with fire.  When the king heard this, then went he\nnorthward with all the force that he could collect, despoiling\nand laying waste the shire withal; whilst the fleet lay all the\nwinter in the Humber, where the king could not come at them.  The\nking was in York on Christmas Day, and so all the winter on land,\nand came to Winchester at Easter.  Bishop Egelric, who was at\nPeterborough, was this year betrayed, and led to Westminster; and\nhis brother Egelwine was outlawed.  This year also died Brand,\nAbbot of Peterborough, on the fifth before the calends of\nDecember.", "A.D. 1070.  This year Landfranc, who was Abbot of Caen, came to\nEngland; and after a few days he became Archbishop of Canterbury.\nHe was invested on the fourth before the calends of September in\nhis own see by eight bishops, his suffragans.  The others, who\nwere not there, by messengers and by letter declared why they\ncould not be there.  The same year Thomas, who was chosen Bishop\nof York, came to Canterbury, to be invested there after the\nancient custom.  But when Landfranc craved confirmation of his\nobedience with an oath, he refused; and said, that he ought not\nto do it.  Whereupon Archbishop Landfranc was wroth, and bade the\nbishops, who were come thither by Archbishop Landfranc's command\nto do the service, and all the monks to unrobe themselves.  And\nthey by his order so did.  Thomas, therefore, for the time,\ndeparted without consecration.  Soon after this, it happened that\nthe Archbishop Landfranc went to Rome, and Thomas with him.  When\nthey came thither, and had spoken about other things concerning\nwhich they wished to speak, then began Thomas his speech: how he\ncame to Canterbury, and how the archbishop required obedience of\nhim with an oath; but he declined it.  Then began the Archbishop\nLandfranc to show with clear distinction, that what he craved he\ncraved by right; and with strong arguments he confirmed the same\nbefore the Pope Alexander, and before all the council that was\ncollected there; and so they went home.  After this came Thomas\nto Canterbury; and all that the archbishop required of him he\nhumbly fulfilled, and afterwards received consecration.  This\nyear Earl Waltheof agreed with the king; but in the Lent of the\nsame year the king ordered all the monasteries in England to be\nplundered.  In the same year came King Sweyne from Denmark into\nthe Humber; and the landsmen came to meet him, and made a treaty\nwith him; thinking that he would overrun the land.  Then came\ninto Ely Christien, the Danish bishop, and Earl Osbern, and the\nDanish domestics with them; and the English people from all the\nfen-lands came to them; supposing that they should win all that\nland.  Then the monks of Peterborough heard say, that their own\nmen would plunder the minster; namely Hereward and his gang:\nbecause they understood that the king had given the abbacy to a\nFrench abbot, whose name was Thorold;--that he was a very stern\nman, and was then come into Stamford with all his Frenchmen.  Now\nthere was a churchwarden, whose name was Yware; who took away by\nnight all that he could, testaments, mass-hackles, cantel-copes,\nand reefs, and such other small things, whatsoever he could; and\nwent early, before day, to the Abbot Thorold; telling him that he\nsought his protection, and informing him how the outlaws were\ncoming to Peterborough, and that he did all by advice of the\nmonks.  Early in the morning came all the outlaws with many\nships, resolving to enter the minster; but the monks withstood,\nso that they could not come in.  Then they laid on fire, and\nburned all the houses of the monks, and all the town except one\nhouse.  Then came they in through fire at the Bull-hithe gate;\nwhere the monks met them, and besought peace of them.  But they\nregarded nothing.  They went into the minster, climbed up to the\nholy rood, took away the diadem from our Lord's head, all of pure\ngold, and seized the bracket that was underneath his feet, which\nwas all of red gold.  They climbed up to the steeple, brought\ndown the table that was hid there, which was all of gold and\nsilver, seized two golden shrines, and nine of silver, and took\naway fifteen large crucifixes, of gold and of silver; in short,\nthey seized there so much gold and silver, and so many treasures,\nin money, in raiment, and in books, as no man could tell another;\nand said, that they did it from their attachment to the minster.\nAfterwards they went to their ships, proceeded to Ely, and\ndeposited there all the treasure.  The Danes, believing that they\nshould overcome the Frenchmen, drove out all the monks; leaving\nthere only one, whose name was Leofwine Lang, who lay sick in the\ninfirmary.  Then came Abbot Thorold and eight times twenty\nFrenchmen with him, all full-armed.  When he came thither, he\nfound all within and without consumed by fire, except the church\nalone; but the outlaws were all with the fleet, knowing that he\nwould come thither.  This was done on the fourth day before the\nnones of June.  The two kings, William and Sweyne, were now\nreconciled; and the Danes went out of Ely with all the aforesaid\ntreasure, and carried it away with them.  But when they came into\nthe middle of the sea, there came a violent storm, and dispersed\nall the ships wherein the treasures were.  Some went to Norway,\nsome to Ireland, some to Denmark.  All that reached the latter,\nconsisted of the table, and some shrines, and some crucifixes,\nand many of the other treasures; which they brought to a king's\ntown, called ----, and deposited it all there in the church.\nAfterwards through their own carelessness, and through their\ndrunkenness, in one night the church and all that was therein was\nconsumed by fire.  Thus was the minster of Peterborough burned\nand plundered.  Almighty God have mercy on it through his great\ngoodness.  Thus came the Abbot Thorold to Peterborough; and the\nmonks too returned, and performed the service of Christ in the\nchurch, which had before stood a full week without any kind of\nrite.  When Bishop Aylric heard it, he excommunicated all the men\nwho that evil deed had done.  There was a great famine this year:\nand in the summer came the fleet in the north from the Humber\ninto the Thames, and lay there two nights, and made afterwards\nfor Denmark.  Earl Baldwin also died, and his son Arnulf\nsucceeded to the earldom.  Earl William, in conjunction with the\nking of the Franks, was to be his guardian; but Earl Robert came\nand slew his kinsman Arnulf and the earl, put the king to flight,\nand slew many thousands of his men.", "A.D. 1071.  This year Earl Edwin and Earl Morkar fled out, (93)\nand roamed at random in woods and in fields.  Then went Earl\nMorkar to Ely by ship; but Earl Edwin was treacherously slain by\nhis own men.  Then came Bishop Aylwine, and Siward Barn, and many\nhundred men with them, into Ely.  When King William heard that,\nthen ordered he out a naval force and land force, and beset the\nland all about, and wrought a bridge, and went in; and the naval\nforce at the same time on the sea-side.  And the outlaws then all\nsurrendered; that was, Bishop Aylwine, and Earl Morkar, and all\nthat were with them; except Hereward (94) alone, and all those\nthat would join him, whom he led out triumphantly.  And the king\ntook their ships, and weapons, and many treasures; (95) and all\nthe men he disposed of as he thought proper.  Bishop Aylwine he\nsent to Abingdon, where he died in the beginning of the winter.", "A.D. 1072.  This year King William led a naval force and a land\nforce to Scotland, and beset that land on the sea-side with\nships, whilst he led his land-force in at the Tweed; (96) but he\nfound nothing there of any value.  King Malcolm, however, came,\nand made peace with King William, and gave hostages, and became\nhis man; whereupon the king returned home with all his force.\nThis year died Bishop Aylric.  He had been invested Bishop of\nYork; but that see was unjustly taken from him, and he then had\nthe bishopric of Durham given him; which he held as long as he\nchose, but resigned it afterwards, and retired to Peterborough\nminster; where he abode twelve years.  After that King William\nwon England, then took he him from Peterborough, and sent him to\nWestminster; where he died on the ides of October, and he is\nthere buried, within the minster, in the porch of St. Nicholas.", "A.D. 1073.  This year led King William an army, English and\nFrench, over sea, and won the district of Maine; which the\nEnglish very much injured by destroying the vineyards, burning\nthe towns, and spoiling the land.  But they subdued it all into\nthe hand of King William, and afterwards returned home to\nEngland.", "A.D. 1074.  This year King William went over sea to Normandy; and\nchild Edgar came from Flanders into Scotland on St. Grimbald's\nmass-day; where King Malcolm and his sister Margaret received him\nwith much pomp.  At the same time sent Philip, the King of\nFrance, a letter to him, bidding him to come to him, and he would\ngive him the castle of Montreuil; that he might afterwards daily\nannoy his enemies.  What then?  King Malcolm and his sister\nMargaret gave him and his men great presents, and many treasures;\nin skins ornamented with purple, in pelisses made of martin-skins,\nof grey-skins, and of ermine-skins, in palls, and in\nvessels of gold and silver; and conducted him and his crew with\ngreat pomp from his territory.  But in their voyage evil befel\nthem; for when they were out at sea, there came upon them such\nrough weather, and the stormy sea and the strong wind drove them\nso violently on the shore, that all their ships burst, and they\nalso themselves came with difficulty to the land.  Their treasure\nwas nearly all lost, and some of his men also were taken by the\nFrench; but he himself and his best men returned again to\nScotland, some roughly travelling on foot, and some miserably\nmounted.  Then King Malcolm advised him to send to King William\nover sea, to request his friendship, which he did; and the king\ngave it him, and sent after him.  Again, therefore, King Malcolm\nand his sister gave him and all his men numberless treasures, and\nagain conducted him very magnificently from their territory.  The\nsheriff of York came to meet him at Durham, and went all the way\nwith him; ordering meat and fodder to be found for him at every\ncastle to which they came, until they came over sea to the king.\nThen King William received him with much pomp; and he was there\nafterwards in his court, enjoying such rights as he confirmed to\nhim by law.", "A.D. 1075.  This year King William gave Earl Ralph the daughter\nof William Fitz-Osborne to wife.  This same Ralph was British on\nhis mother's side; but his father, whose name was also Ralph, was\nEnglish; and born in Norfolk.  The king therefore gave his son\nthe earldom of Norfolk and Suffolk; and he then led the bride to\nNorwich.\n          There was that bride-ale\n          The source of man's bale.\nThere was Earl Roger, and Earl Waltheof, and bishops, and abbots;\nwho there resolved, that they would drive the king out of the\nrealm of England.  But it was soon told the king in Normandy how\nit was determined.  It was Earl Roger and Earl Ralph who were the\nauthors of that plot; and who enticed the Britons to them, and\nsent eastward to Denmark after a fleet to assist them.  Roger\nwent westward to his earldom, and collected his people there, to\nthe king's annoyance, as he thought; but it was to the great\ndisadvantage of himself.  He was however prevented.  Ralph also\nin his earldom would go forth with his people; but the castlemen\nthat were in England and also the people of the land, came\nagainst him, and prevented him from doing anything.  He escaped\nhowever to the ships at Norwich. (97)  And his wife was in the\ncastle; which she held until peace was made with her; when she\nwent out of England, with all her men who wished to join her.\nThe king afterwards came to England, and seized Earl Roger, his\nrelative, and put him in prison.  And Earl Waltheof went over\nsea, and bewrayed himself; but he asked forgiveness, and\nproffered gifts of ransom.  The king, however, let him off\nlightly, until he (98) came to England; when he had him seized.\nSoon after that came east from Denmark two hundred ships; wherein\nwere two captains, Cnute Swainson, and Earl Hacco; but they durst\nnot maintain a fight with King William.  They went rather to\nYork, and broke into St. Peter's minster, and took therein much\ntreasure, and so went away.  They made for Flanders over sea; but\nthey all perished who were privy to that design; that was, the\nson of Earl Hacco, and many others with him.  This year died the\nLady Edgitha, who was the relict of King Edward, seven nights\nbefore Christmas, at Winchester; and the king caused her to be\nbrought to Westminster with great pomp; and he laid her with King\nEdward, her lord.  And the king was then at Westminster, at\nmidwinter; where all the Britons were condemned who were at the\nbride-ale at Norwich.  Some were punished with blindness; some\nwere driven from the land; and some were towed to Scandinavia.\nSo were the traitors of King William subdued.", "A.D. 1076.  This year died Sweyne, King of Denmark; and Harold\nhis son took to the kingdom.  And the king gave the abbacy of\nWestminster to Abbot Vitalis, who had been Abbot of Bernay.  This\nyear also was Earl Waltheof beheaded at Winchester, on the mass-day\nof St. Petronilla; (99) and his body was carried to Croyland,\nwhere he lies buried.  King William now went over sea, and led\nhis army to Brittany, and beset the castle of Dol; but the\nBretons defended it, until the king came from France; whereupon\nWilliam departed thence, having lost there both men and horses,\nand many of his treasures.", "A.D. 1077.  This year were reconciled the king of the Franks and\nWilliam, King of England.  But it continued only a little while.\nThis year was London burned, one night before the Assumption of\nSt. Mary, so terribly as it never was before, since it was built.\nThis year the moon was eclipsed three nights before Candlemas;\nand in the same year died Aylwy, the prudent Abbot of Evesham, on\nthe fourteenth day before the calends of March, on the mass-day\nof St. Juliana; and Walter was appointed abbot in his stead; and\nBishop Herman also died, on the tenth day before the calends of\nMarch, who was Bishop in Berkshire, and in Wiltshire, and in\nDorsetshire.  This year also King Malcolm won the mother of\nMalslaythe.... and all his best men, and all his treasures, and\nhis cattle; and he himself not easily escaped.... This year also\nwas the dry summer; and wild fire came upon many shires, and\nburned many towns; and also many cities were ruined thereby.", "A.D. 1079.  This year Robert, the son of King William, deserted\nfrom his father to his uncle Robert in Flanders; because his\nfather would not let him govern his earldom in Normandy; which he\nhimself, and also King Philip with his permission, had given him.\nThe best men that were in the land also had sworn oaths of\nallegiance to him, and taken him for their lord.  This year,\ntherefore, Robert fought with his father, without Normandy, by a\ncastle called Gerberoy; and wounded him in the hand; and his\nhorse, that he sat upon, was killed under him; and he that\nbrought him another was killed there right with a dart.  That was\nTookie Wiggodson.  Many were there slain, and also taken.  His\nson William too was there wounded; but Robert returned to\nFlanders.  We will not here, however, record any more injury that\nhe did his father.  This year came King Malcolm from Scotland\ninto England, betwixt the two festivals of St. Mary, with a large\narmy, which plundered Northumberland till it came to the Tine,\nand slew many hundreds of men, and carried home much coin, and\ntreasure, and men in captivity.", "A.D. 1080.  This year was Bishop Walker slain in Durham, at a\ncouncil; and an hundred men with him, French and Flemish.  He\nhimself was born in Lorrain.  This did the Northumbrians in the\nmonth of May. (100)", "A.D. 1081.  This year the king led an army into Wales, and there\nfreed many hundreds of men.", "A.D. 1082.  This year the king seized Bishop Odo; and this year\nalso was a great famine.", "A.D. 1083.  This year arose the tumult at Glastonbury betwixt the\nAbbot Thurstan and his monks.  It proceeded first from the\nabbot's want of wisdom, that he misgoverned his monks in many\nthings.  But the monks meant well to him; and told him that he\nshould govern them rightly, and love them, and they would be\nfaithful and obedient to him.  The abbot, however, would hear\nnothing of this; but evil entreated them, and threatened them\nworse.  One day the abbot went into the chapter-house, and spoke\nagainst the monks, and attempted to mislead them; (101) and sent\nafter some laymen, and they came full-armed into the chapter-house\nupon the monks.  Then were the monks very much afraid (102)\nof them, and wist not what they were to do, but they shot\nforward, and some ran into the church, and locked the doors after\nthem.  But they followed them into the minster, and resolved to\ndrag them out, so that they durst not go out.  A rueful thing\nhappened on that day.  The Frenchmen broke into the choir, and\nhurled their weapons toward the altar, where the monks were; and\nsome of the knights went upon the upper floor, (103) and shot\ntheir arrows downward incessantly toward the sanctuary; so that\non the crucifix that stood above the altar they stuck many\narrows.  And the wretched monks lay about the altar, and some\ncrept under, and earnestly called upon God, imploring his mercy,\nsince they could not obtain any at the hands of men.  What can we\nsay, but that they continued to shoot their arrows; whilst the\nothers broke down the doors, and came in, and slew (104) some of\nthe monks to death, and wounded many therein; so that the blood\ncame from the altar upon the steps, and from the steps on the\nfloor.  Three there were slain to death, and eighteen wounded.\nAnd in this same year departed Matilda, queen of King William, on\nthe day after All-Hallow-mass.  And in the same year also, after\nmid-winter, the king ordained a large and heavy contribution\n(105) over all England; that was, upon each hide of land, two and\nseventy pence.", "A.D. 1084.  In this year died Wulfwold, Abbot of Chertsey, on the\nthirteenth day before the calends of May.", "A.D. 1085.  In this year men reported, and of a truth asserted,\nthat Cnute, King of Denmark, son of King Sweyne, was coming\nhitherward, and was resolved to win this land, with the\nassistance of Robert, Earl of Flanders; (106) for Cnute had\nRobert's daughter.  When William, King of England, who was then\nresident in Normandy (for he had both England and Normandy),\nunderstood this, he went into England with so large an army of\nhorse and foot, from France and Brittany, as never before sought\nthis land; so that men wondered how this land could feed all that\nforce.  But the king left the army to shift for themselves\nthrough all this land amongst his subjects, who fed them, each\naccording to his quota of land.  Men suffered much distress this\nyear; and the king caused the land to be laid waste about the sea\ncoast; that, if his foes came up, they might not have anything on\nwhich they could very readily seize.  But when the king\nunderstood of a truth that his foes were impeded, and could not\nfurther their expedition, (107) then let he some of the army go\nto their own land; but some he held in this land over the winter.\nThen, at the midwinter, was the king in Glocester with his\ncouncil, and held there his court five days.  And afterwards the\narchbishop and clergy had a synod three days.  There was\nMauritius chosen Bishop of London, William of Norfolk, and Robert\nof Cheshire.  These were all the king's clerks.  After this had\nthe king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his\ncouncil, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort\nof men.  Then sent he his men over all England into each shire;\ncommissioning them to find out \"How many hundreds of hides were\nin the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon\nthe land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the\nshire.\"  Also he commissioned them to record in writing, \"How\nmuch land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his\nabbots, and his earls;\" and though I may be prolix and tedious,\n\"What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in\nEngland, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were\nworth.\"  So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to\ntrace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard\n(108) of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he\nthought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a\nswine was there left, that was not set down in his writ.  And all\nthe recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him. (109)", "A.D. 1086.  This year the king bare his crown, and held his\ncourt, in Winchester at Easter; and he so arranged, that he was\nby the Pentecost at Westminster, and dubbed his son Henry a\nknight there.  Afterwards he moved about so that he came by\nLammas to Sarum; where he was met by his councillors; and all the\nlandsmen that were of any account over all England became this\nman's vassals as they were; and they all bowed themselves before\nhim, and became his men, and swore him oaths of allegiance that\nthey would against all other men be faithful to him.  Thence he\nproceeded into the Isle of Wight; because he wished to go into\nNormandy, and so he afterwards did; though he first did according\nto his custom; he collected a very large sum from his people,\nwherever he could make any demand, whether with justice or\notherwise.  Then he went into Normandy; and Edgar Etheling, the\nrelation of King Edward, revolted from him, for he received not\nmuch honour from him; but may the Almighty God give him honour\nhereafter.  And Christina, the sister of the etheling, went into\nthe monastery of Rumsey, and received the holy veil.  And the\nsame year there was a very heavy season, and a swinkful and\nsorrowful year in England, in murrain of cattle, and corn and\nfruits were at a stand, and so much untowardness in the weather,\nas a man may not easily think; so tremendous was the thunder and\nlightning, that it killed many men; and it continually grew worse\nand worse with men.  May God Almighty better it whenever it be\nhis will.", "A.D. 1087.  After the birth of our Lord and Saviour Christ, one\nthousand and eighty-seven winters; in the one and twentieth year\nafter William began to govern and direct England, as God granted\nhim, was a very heavy and pestilent season in this land.  Such a\nsickness came on men, that full nigh every other man was in the\nworst disorder, that is, in the diarrhoea; and that so\ndreadfully, that many men died in the disorder.  Afterwards came,\nthrough the badness of the weather as we before mentioned, so\ngreat a famine over all England, that many hundreds of men died a\nmiserable death through hunger.  Alas!  how wretched and how\nrueful a time was there!  When the poor wretches lay full nigh\ndriven to death prematurely, and afterwards came sharp hunger,\nand dispatched them withall!  Who will not be penetrated with\ngrief at such a season?  or who is so hardhearted as not to weep\nat such misfortune?  Yet such things happen for folks' sins, that\nthey will not love God and righteousness.  So it was in those\ndays, that little righteousness was in this land with any men but\nwith the monks alone, wherever they fared well.  The king and the\nhead men loved much, and overmuch, covetousness in gold and in\nsilver; and recked not how sinfully it was got, provided it came\nto them.  The king let his land at as high a rate as he possibly\ncould; then came some other person, and bade more than the former\none gave, and the king let it to the men that bade him more.\nThen came the third, and bade yet more; and the king let it to\nhand to the men that bade him most of all: and he recked not how\nvery sinfully the stewards got it of wretched men, nor how many\nunlawful deeds they did; but the more men spake about right law,\nthe more unlawfully they acted.  They erected unjust tolls, and\nmany other unjust things they did, that are difficult to reckon.\nAlso in the same year, before harvest, the holy minster of St.\nPaul, the episcopal see in London, was completely burned, with\nmany other minsters, and the greatest part, and the richest of\nthe whole city.  So also, about the same time, full nigh each\nhead-port in all England was entirely burned.  Alas!  rueful and\nwoeful was the fate of the year that brought forth so many\nmisfortunes.  In the same year also, before the Assumption of St.\nMary, King William went from Normandy into France with an army,\nand made war upon his own lord Philip, the king, and slew many of\nhis men, and burned the town of Mante, and all the holy minsters\nthat were in the town; and two holy men that served God, leading\nthe life of anachorets, were burned therein.  This being thus\ndone, King William returned to Normandy.  Rueful was the thing he\ndid; but a more rueful him befel.  How more rueful?  He fell\nsick, and it dreadfully ailed him.  What shall I say?  Sharp\ndeath, that passes by neither rich men nor poor, seized him also.\nHe died in Normandy, on the next day after the Nativity of St.\nMary, and he was buried at Caen in St. Stephen's minster, which\nhe had formerly reared, and afterwards endowed with manifold\ngifts.  Alas!  how false and how uncertain is this world's weal!\nHe that was before a rich king, and lord of many lands, had not\nthen of all his land more than a space of seven feet!  and he\nthat was whilom enshrouded in gold and gems, lay there covered\nwith mould!  He left behind him three sons; the eldest, called\nRobert, who was earl in Normandy after him; the second, called\nWilliam, who wore the crown after him in England; and the third,\ncalled Henry, to whom his father bequeathed immense treasure.  If\nany person wishes to know what kind of man he was, or what honour\nhe had, or of how many lands he was lord, then will we write\nabout him as well as we understand him: we who often looked upon\nhim, and lived sometime in his court.  This King William then\nthat we speak about was a very wise man, and very rich; more\nsplendid and powerful than any of his predecessors were.  He was\nmild to the good men that loved God, and beyond all measure\nsevere to the men that gainsayed his will.  On that same spot\nwhere God granted him that he should gain England, he reared a\nmighty minster, and set monks therein, and well endowed it.  In\nhis days was the great monastery in Canterbury built, and also\nvery many others over all England.  This land was moreover well\nfilled with monks, who modelled their lives after the rule of St.\nBenedict.  But such was the state of Christianity in his time,\nthat each man followed what belonged to his profession--he that\nwould.  He was also very dignified.  Thrice he bare his crown\neach year, as oft as he was in England.  At Easter he bare it in\nWinchester, at Pentecost in Westminster, at midwinter in\nGlocester.  And then were with him all the rich men over all\nEngland; archbishops and diocesan bishops, abbots and earls,\nthanes and knights.  So very stern was he also and hot, that no\nman durst do anything against his will.  He had earls in his\ncustody, who acted against his will.  Bishops he hurled from\ntheir bishoprics, and abbots from their abbacies, and thanes into\nprison.  At length he spared not his own brother Odo, who was a\nvery rich bishop in Normandy.  At Baieux was his episcopal stall;\nand he was the foremost man of all to aggrandise the king.  He\nhad an earldom in England; and when the king was in Normandy,\nthen was he the mightiest man in this land.  Him he confined in\nprison.  But amongst other things is not to be forgotten that\ngood peace that he made in this land; so that a man of any\naccount might go over his kingdom unhurt with his bosom full of\ngold.  No man durst slay another, had he never so much evil done\nto the other; and if any churl lay with a woman against her will,\nhe soon lost the limb that he played with.  He truly reigned over\nEngland; and by his capacity so thoroughly surveyed it, that\nthere was not a hide of land in England that he wist not who had\nit, or what it was worth, and afterwards set it down in his book.\n(110)  The land of the Britons was in his power; and he wrought\ncastles therein; and ruled Anglesey withal.  So also he subdued\nScotland by his great strength.  As to Normandy, that was his\nnative land; but he reigned also over the earldom called Maine;\nand if he might have yet lived two years more, he would have won\nIreland by his valour, and without any weapons.  Assuredly in his\ntime had men much distress, and very many sorrows.  Castles he\nlet men build, and miserably swink the poor.  The king himself\nwas so very rigid; and extorted from his subjects many marks of\ngold, and many hundred pounds of silver; which he took of his\npeople, for little need, by right and by unright.  He was fallen\ninto covetousness, and greediness he loved withal.  He made many\ndeer-parks; and he established laws therewith; so that whosoever\nslew a hart, or a hind, should be deprived of his eyesight.  As\nhe forbade men to kill the harts, so also the boars; and he loved\nthe tall deer as if he were their father.  Likewise he decreed by\nthe hares, that they should go free.  His rich men bemoaned it,\nand the poor men shuddered at it.  But he was so stern, that he\nrecked not the hatred of them all; for they must follow withal\nthe king's will, if they would live, or have land, or\npossessions, or even his peace.  Alas!  that any man should\npresume so to puff himself up, and boast o'er all men.  May the\nAlmighty God show mercy to his soul, and grant him forgiveness of\nhis sins!  These things have we written concerning him, both good\nand evil; that men may choose the good after their goodness, and\nflee from the evil withal, and go in the way that leadeth us to\nthe kingdom of heaven.  Many things may we write that were done\nin this same year.  So it was in Denmark, that the Danes, a\nnation that was formerly accounted the truest of all, were turned\naside to the greatest untruth, and to the greatest treachery that\never could be.  They chose and bowed to King Cnute, and swore him\noaths, and afterwards dastardly slew him in a church.  It\nhappened also in Spain, that the heathens went and made inroads\nupon the Christians, and reduced much of the country to their\ndominion.  But the king of the Christians, Alphonzo by name, sent\neverywhere into each land, and desired assistance.  And they came\nto his support from every land that was Christian; and they went\nand slew or drove away all the heathen folk, and won their land\nagain, through God's assistance.  In this land also, in the same\nyear, died many rich men; Stigand, Bishop of Chichester, and the\nAbbot of St. Augustine, and the Abbot of Bath, and the Abbot of\nPershore, and the lord of them all, William, King of England,\nthat we spoke of before.  After his death his son, called William\nalso as the father, took to the kingdom, and was blessed to king\nby Archbishop Landfranc at Westminster three days ere Michaelmas\nday.  And all the men in England submitted to him, and swore\noaths to him.  This being thus done, the king went to Winchester,\nand opened the treasure house, and the treasures that his father\nhad gathered, in gold, and in silver, and in vases, and in palls,\nand in gems, and in many other valuable things that are difficult\nto enumerate.  Then the king did as his father bade him ere he\nwas dead; he there distributed treasures for his father's soul to\neach monastery that was in England; to some ten marks of gold, to\nsome six, to each upland (111) church sixty pence.  And into each\nshire were sent a hundred pounds of money to distribute amongst\npoor men for his soul.  And ere he departed, he bade that they\nshould release all the men that were in prison under his power.\nAnd the king was on the midwinter in London.", "A.D. 1088.  In this year was this land much stirred, and filled\nwith great treachery; so that the richest Frenchmen that were in\nthis land would betray their lord the king, and would have his\nbrother Robert king, who was earl in Normandy.  In this design\nwas engaged first Bishop Odo, and Bishop Gosfrith, and William,\nBishop of Durham.  So well did the king by the bishop [Odo] that\nall England fared according to his counsel, and as he would.  And\nthe bishop thought to do by him as Judas Iscariot did by our\nLord.  And Earl Roger was also of this faction; and much people\nwas with him all Frenchmen.  This conspiracy was formed in Lent.\nAs soon as Easter came, then went they forth, and harrowed, and\nburned, and wasted the king's farms; and they despoiled the lands\nof all the men that were in the king's service.  And they each of\nthem went to his castle, and manned it, and provisioned it as\nwell as they could.  Bishop Gosfrith, and Robert the peace-breaker,\nwent to Bristol, and plundered it, and brought the spoil\nto the castle.  Afterwards they went out of the castle, and\nplundered Bath, and all the land thereabout; and all the honor\n(112) of Berkeley they laid waste.  And the men that eldest were\nof Hereford, and all the shire forthwith, and the men of\nShropshire, with much people of Wales, came and plundered and\nburned in Worcestershire, until they came to the city itself,\nwhich it was their design to set on fire, and then to rifle the\nminster, and win the king's castle to their hands.  The worthy\nBishop Wulfstan, seeing these things, was much agitated in his\nmind, because to him was betaken the custody of the castle.\nNevertheless his hired men went out of the castle with few\nattendants, and, through God's mercy and the bishop's merits,\nslew or took five hundred men, and put all the others to flight.\nThe Bishop of Durham did all the harm that he could over all by\nthe north.  Roger was the name of one of them; (113) who leaped\ninto the castle at Norwich, and did yet the worst of all over all\nthat land.  Hugh also was one, who did nothing better either in\nLeicestershire or in Northamptonshire.  The Bishop Odo being one,\nthough of the same family from which the king himself was\ndescended, went into Kent to his earldom, and greatly despoiled\nit; and having laid waste the lands of the king and of the\narchbishop withal, he brought the booty into his castle at\nRochester.  When the king understood all these things, and what\ntreachery they were employing against him, then was he in his\nmind much agitated.  He then sent after Englishmen, described to\nthem his need, earnestly requested their support, and promised\nthem the best laws that ever before were in this land; each\nunright guild he forbade, and restored to the men their woods and\nchaces.  But it stood no while.  The Englishmen however went to\nthe assistance of the king their lord.  They advanced toward\nRochester, with a view to get possession of the Bishop Odo; for\nthey thought, if they had him who was at first the head of the\nconspiracy, they might the better get possession of all the\nothers.  They came then to the castle at Tunbridge; and there\nwere in the castle the knights of Bishop Odo, and many others who\nwere resolved to hold it against the king.  But the Englishmen\nadvanced, and broke into the castle, and the men that were\ntherein agreed with the king.  The king with his army went toward\nRochester.  And they supposed that the bishop was therein; but it\nwas made known to the king that the bishop was gone to the castle\nat Pevensea.  And the king with his army went after, and beset\nthe castle about with a very large force full six weeks.  During\nthis time the Earl of Normandy, Robert, the king's brother,\ngathered a very considerable force, and thought to win England\nwith the support of those men that were in this land against the\nking.  And he sent some of his men to this land, intending to\ncome himself after.  But the Englishmen that guarded the sea\nlighted upon some of the men, and slew them, and drowned more\nthan any man could tell.  When provisions afterwards failed those\nwithin the castle, they earnestly besought peace, and gave\nthemselves up to the king; and the bishop swore that he would\ndepart out of England, and no more come on this land, unless the\nking sent after him, and that he would give up the castle at\nRochester.  Just as the bishop was going with an intention to\ngive up the castle, and the king had sent his men with him, then\narose the men that were in the castle, and took the bishop and\nthe king's men, and put them into prison.  In the castle were\nsome very good knights; Eustace the Young, and the three sons of\nEarl Roger, and all the best born men that were in this land or\nin Normandy.  When the king understood this thing, then went he\nafter with the army that he had there, and sent over all England.\nand bade that each man that was faithful should come to him,\nFrench and English, from sea-port and from upland.  Then came to\nhim much people; and he went to Rochester, and beset the castle,\nuntil they that were therein agreed, and gave up the castle.  The\nBishop Odo with the men that were in the castle went over sea,\nand the bishop thus abandoned the dignity that he had in this\nland.  The king afterwards sent an army to Durham, and allowed it\nto beset the castle, and the bishop agreed, and gave up the\ncastle, and relinquished his bishopric, and went to Normandy.\nMany Frenchmen also abandoned their lands, and went over sea; and\nthe king gave their lands to the men that were faithful to him.", "A.D. 1089.  In this year the venerable father and favourer of\nmonks, Archbishop Landfranc, departed this life; but we hope that\nhe is gone to the heavenly kingdom.  There was also over all\nEngland much earth-stirring on the third day before the ides of\nAugust, and it was a very late year in corn, and in every kind of\nfruits, so that many men reaped their corn about Martinmas, and\nyet later.", "A.D. 1090.  Indiction XIII.  These things thus done, just as we\nhave already said above, by the king, and by his brother and by\nthis men, the king was considering how he might wreak his\nvengeance on his brother Robert, harass him most, and win\nNormandy of him.  And indeed through his craft, or through\nbribery, he got possession of the castle at St. Valeri, and the\nhaven; and so he got possession of that at Albemarle.  And\ntherein he set his knights; and they did harm to the land in\nharrowing and burning.  After this he got possession of more\ncastles in the land; and therein lodged his horsemen.  When the\nEarl of Normandy, Robert, understood that his sworn men deceived\nhim, and gave up their castles to do him harm, then sent he to\nhis lord, Philip, king of the Franks; and he came to Normandy\nwith a large army, and the king and the earl with an immense\nforce beset the castle about, wherein were the men of the King of\nEngland.  But the King William of England sent to Philip, king of\nthe Franks; and he for his love, or for his great treasure,\nabandoned thus his subject the Earl Robert and his land; and\nreturned again to France, and let them so remain.  And in the\nmidst of these things this land was much oppressed by unlawful\nexactions and by many other misfortunes.", "A.D. 1091.  In this year the King William held his court at\nChristmas in Westminster, and thereafter at Candlemas he went,\nfor the annoyance of his brother, out of England into Normandy.\nWhilst he was there, their reconciliation took place, on the\ncondition, that the earl put into his hands Feschamp, and the\nearldom of Ou, and Cherbourg; and in addition to this, that the\nking's men should be secure in the castles that they had won\nagainst the will of the earl.  And the king in return promised\nhim those many [castles] that their father had formerly won, and\nalso to reduce those that had revolted from the earl, also all\nthat his father had there beyond, except those that he had then\ngiven the king, and that all those, that in England before for\nthe earl had lost their land, should have it again by this\ntreaty, and that the earl should have in England just so much as\nwas specified in this agreement.  And if the earl died without a\nson by lawful wedlock, the king should be heir of all Normandy;\nand by virtue of this same treaty, if the king died, the earl\nshould be heir of all England.  To this treaty swore twelve of\nthe best men of the king's side, and twelve of the earl's, though\nit stood but a little while afterwards.  In the midst of this\ntreaty was Edgar Etheling deprived of the land that the earl had\nbefore permitted him to keep in hand; and he went out of Normandy\nto the king, his sister's husband, in Scotland, and to his\nsister.  Whilst the King William was out of England, the King\nMalcolm of Scotland came hither into England, and overran a great\ndeal of it, until the good men that governed this land sent an\narmy against him and repulsed him.  When the King William in\nNormandy heard this, then prepared he his departure, and came to\nEngland, and his brother, the Earl Robert, with him; and he soon\nissued an order to collect a force both naval and military; but\nthe naval force, ere it could come to Scotland, perished almost\nmiserably, a few days before St. Michael's mass.  And the king\nand his brother proceeded with the land-force; but when the King\nMalcolm heard that they were resolved to seek him with an army,\nhe went with his force out of Scotland into Lothaine in England,\nand there abode.  When the King William came near with his army,\nthen interceded between them Earl Robert, and Edgar Etheling, and\nso made the peace of the kings, that the King Malcolm came to our\nking, and did homage, (114) promising all such obedience as he\nformerly paid to his father; and that he confirmed with an oath.\nAnd the King William promised him in land and in all things\nwhatever he formerly had under his father.  In this settlement\nwas also Edgar Etheling united with the king.  And the kings then\nwith much satisfaction departed; yet that stood but a little\nwhile.  And the Earl Robert tarried here full nigh until\nChristmas with the king, and during this time found but little of\nthe truth of their agreement; and two days before that tide he\ntook ship in the Isle of Wight, and went into Normandy, and Edgar\nEtheling with him.", "A.D. 1092.  In this year the King William with a large army went\nnorth to Carlisle, and restored the town, and reared the castle,\nand drove out Dolphin that before governed the land, and set his\nown men in the castle, and then returned hither southward.  And a\nvast number of rustic people with wives and with cattle he sent\nthither, to dwell there in order to till the land.", "A.D. 1093.  In this year, during Lent, was the King William at\nGlocester so sick, that he was by all reported dead.  And in his\nillness he made many good promises to lead his own life aright;\nto grant peace and protection to the churches of God, and never\nmore again with fee to sell; to have none but righteous laws\namongst his people.  The archbishopric of Canterbury, that before\nremained in his own hand, he transferred to Anselm, who was\nbefore Abbot of Bec; to Robert his chancellor the bishopric of\nLincoln; and to many minsters he gave land; but that he\nafterwards took away, when he was better, and annulled all the\ngood laws that he promised us before.  Then after this sent the\nKing of Scotland, and demanded the fulfilment of the treaty that\nwas promised him.  And the King William cited him to Glocester,\nand sent him hostages to Scotland; and Edgar Etheling,\nafterwards, and the men returned, that brought him with great\ndignity to the king.  But when he came to the king, he could not\nbe considered worthy either of our king's speech, or of the\nconditions that were formerly promised him.  For this reason\ntherefore they parted with great dissatisfaction, and the King\nMalcolm returned to Scotland.  And soon after he came home, he\ngathered his army, and came harrowing into England with more\nhostility than behoved him; and Robert, the Earl of\nNorthumberland, surrounded him unawares with his men, and slew\nhim.  Morel of Barnborough slew him, who was the earl's steward,\nand a baptismal friend (115) of King Malcolm.  With him was also\nslain Edward his son; who after him should have been king, if he\nhad lived.  When the good Queen Margaret heard this--her most\nbeloved lord and son thus betrayed she was in her mind almost\ndistracted to death.  She with her priests went to church, and\nperformed her rites, and prayed before God, that she might give\nup the ghost.  And the Scots then chose (116) Dufenal to king,\nMalcolm's brother, and drove out all the English that formerly\nwere with the King Malcolm.  When Duncan, King Malcolm's son,\nheard all that had thus taken place (he was then in the King\nWilliam's court, because his father had given him as a hostage to\nour king's father, and so he lived here afterwards), he came to\nthe king, and did such fealty as the king required at his hands;\nand so with his permission went to Scotland, with all the support\nthat he could get of English and French, and deprived his uncle\nDufenal of the kingdom, and was received as king.  But the Scots\nafterwards gathered some force together, and slew full nigh all\nhis men; and he himself with a few made his escape. (117)\nAfterwards they were reconciled, on the condition that he never\nagain brought into the land English or French.", "A.D. 1094.  This year the King William held his court at\nChristmas in Glocester; and messengers came to him thither from\nhis brother Robert of Normandy; who said that his brother\nrenounced all peace and conditions, unless the king would fulfil\nall that they had stipulated in the treaty; and upon that he\ncalled him forsworn and void of truth, unless he adhered to the\ntreaty, or went thither and explained himself there, where the\ntreaty was formerly made and also sworn.  Then went the king to\nHastings at Candlemas; and whilst he there abode waiting the\nweather, he let hallow the minster at Battel, and deprived\nHerbert Losang, the Bishop of Thetford, of his staff; and\nthereafter about mid-Lent went over sea into Normandy.  After he\ncame, thither, he and his brother Robert, the earl, said that\nthey should come together in peace (and so they did), and might\nbe united.  Afterwards they came together with the same men that\nbefore made the treaty, and also confirmed it by oaths; and all\nthe blame of breaking the treaty they threw upon the king; but he\nwould not confess this, nor even adhere to the treaty; and for\nthis reason they parted with much dissatisfaction.  And the king\nafterwards won the castle at Bures, and took the earl's men\ntherein; some of whom he sent hither to this land.  On the other\nhand the earl, with the assistance of the King of France, won the\ncastle at Argence, and took therein Roger of Poitou, (118) and\nseven hundred of the king's knights with him; and afterwards that\nat Hulme; and oft readily did either of them burn the towns of\nthe other, and also took men.  Then sent the king hither to this\nland, and ordered twenty thousand Englishmen to be sent out to\nNormandy to his assistance; but when they came to sea, they then\nhad orders to return, and to pay to the king's behoof the fee\nthat they had taken; which was half a pound each man; and they\ndid so.  And the earl after this, with the King of France, and\nwith all that he could gather together, went through the midst of\nNormandy, towards Ou, where the King William was, and thought to\nbesiege him within; and so they advanced until they came to\nLuneville.  There was the King of France through cunning turned\naside; and so afterwards all the army dispersed.  In the midst of\nthese things the King William sent after his brother Henry, who\nwas in the castle at Damfront; but because he could not go\nthrough Normandy with security, he sent ships after him, and\nHugh, Earl of Chester.  When, however, they should have gone\ntowards Ou where the king was, they went to England, and came up\nat Hamton, (119) on the eve of the feast of All Saints, and here\nafterwards abode; and at Christmas they were in London.  In this\nsame year also the Welshmen gathered themselves together, and\nwith the French that were in Wales, or in the neighbourhood, and\nhad formerly seized their land, stirred up war, and broke into\nmany fastnesses and castles, and slew many men.  And when their\nfollowers had increased, they divided themselves into larger\nparties.  With some part of them fought Hugh, Earl of Shropshire,\n(120) and put them to flight.  Nevertheless the other part of\nthem all this year omitted no evil that they could do.  This year\nalso the Scots ensnared their king, Duncan, and slew him; and\nafterwards, the second time, took his uncle Dufenal to king,\nthrough whose instruction and advice he was betrayed to death.", "A.D. 1095.  In this year was the King William the first four days\nof Christmas at Whitsand, and after the fourth day came hither,\nand landed at Dover.  And Henry, the king's brother, abode in\nthis land until Lent, and then went over sea to Normandy, with\nmuch treasure, on the king's behalf, against their brother, Earl\nRobert, and frequently fought against the earl, and did him much\nharm, both in land and in men.  And then at Easter held the king\nhis court in Winchester; and the Earl Robert of Northumberland\nwould not come to court.  And the king was much stirred to anger\nwith him for this, and sent to him, and bade him harshly, if he\nwould be worthy of protection, that he would come to court at\nPentecost.  In this year was Easter on the eighth day before the\ncalends of April; and upon Easter, on the night of the feast of\nSt Ambrose, that is, the second before the nones of April, (121)\nnearly over all this land, and almost all the night, numerous and\nmanifold stars were seen to fall from heaven; not by one or two,\nbut so thick in succession, that no man could tell it.  Hereafter\nat Pentecost was the king at Windsor, and all his council with\nhim, except the Earl of Northumberland; for the king would\nneither give him hostages, nor own upon truth, that he might come\nand go with security.  And the king therefore ordered his army,\nand went against the earl to Northumberland; and soon after he\ncame thither, he won many and nearly all the best of the earl's\nclan in a fortress, and put them into custody; and the castle at\nTinemouth he beset until he won it, and the earl's brother\ntherein, and all that were with him; and afterwards went to\nBamborough, and beset the earl therein.  But when the king saw\nthat he could not win it, then ordered he his men to make a\ncastle before Bamborough, and called it in his speech\n\"Malveisin\"; that is in English, \"Evil Neighbour\".  And he\nfortified it strongly with his men, and afterwards went\nsouthward.  Then, soon after that the king was gone south, went\nthe earl one night out of Bamborough towards Tinemouth; but they\nthat were in the new castle were aware of him, and went after\nhim, and fought him, and wounded him, and afterwards took him.\nAnd of those that were with him some they slew, and some they\ntook alive.  Among these things it was made known to the king,\nthat the Welshmen in Wales had broken into a castle called\nMontgomery, and slain the men of Earl Hugo, that should have held\nit.  He therefore gave orders to levy another force immediately,\nand after Michaelmas went into Wales, and shifted his forces, and\nwent through all that land, so that the army came all together by\nAll Saints to Snowdon.  But the Welsh always went before into the\nmountains and the moors, that no man could come to them.  The\nking then went homeward; for he saw that he could do no more\nthere this winter.  When the king came home again, he gave orders\nto take the Earl Robert of Northumberland, and lead him to\nBamborough, and put out both his eyes, unless they that were\ntherein would give up the castle.  His wife held it, and Morel\nwho was steward, and also his relative.  Through this was the\ncastle then given up; and Morel was then in the king's court; and\nthrough him were many both of the clergy and laity surrendered,\nwho with their counsels had conspired against the king.  The king\nhad before this time commanded some to be brought into prison,\nand afterwards had it very strictly proclaimed over all this\ncountry, \"That all who held land of the king, as they wished to\nbe considered worthy of protection, should come to court at the\ntime appointed.\"  And the king commanded that the Earl Robert\nshould be led to Windsor, and there held in the castle.  Also in\nthis same year, against Easter, came the pope's nuncio hither to\nthis land.  This was Bishop Walter, a man of very good life, of\nthe town of Albano; and upon the day of Pentecost on the behalf\nof Pope Urban he gave Archbishop Anselm his pall, and he received\nhim at his archiepiscopal stall in Canterbury.  And Bishop Walter\nremained afterwards in this land a great part of the year; and\nmen then sent by him the Rome-scot, (122) which they had not done\nfor many years before.  This same year also the weather was very\nunseasonable; in consequence of which throughout all this land\nwere all the fruits of the earth reduced to a moderate crop.", "A.D. 1096.  In this year held the King William his court at\nChristmas in Windsor; and William Bishop of Durham died there on\nnew-year's day; and on the octave of the Epiphany was the king\nand all his councillors at Salisbury.  There Geoffry Bainard\nchallenged William of Ou, the king's relative, maintaining that\nhe had been in the conspiracy against the king.  And he fought\nwith him, and overcame him in single combat; and after he was\novercome, the king gave orders to put out his eyes, and\nafterwards to emasculate him; and his steward, William by name,\nwho was the son of his stepmother, the king commanded to be\nhanged on a gibbet.  Then was also Eoda, Earl of Champagne, the\nking's son-in-law, and many others, deprived of their lands;\nwhilst some were led to London, and there killed.  This year\nalso, at Easter, there was a very great stir through all this\nnation and many others, on account of Urban, who was declared\nPope, though he had nothing of a see at Rome.  And an immense\nmultitude went forth with their wives and children, that they\nmight make war upon the heathens.  Through this expedition were\nthe king and his brother, Earl Robert, reconciled; so that the\nking went over sea, and purchased all Normandy of him, on\ncondition that they should be united.  And the earl afterwards\ndeparted; and with him the Earl of Flanders, and the Earl of\nBoulogne, and also many other men of rank (123).  And the Earl\nRobert, and they that went with him, passed the winter in Apulia;\nbut of the people that went by Hungary many thousands miserably\nperished there and by the way.  And many dragged themselves home\nrueful and hunger-bitten on the approach of winter.  This was a\nvery heavy-timed year through all England, both through the\nmanifold tributes, and also through the very heavy-timed hunger\nthat severely oppressed this earth in the course of the year.  In\nthis year also the principal men who held this land, frequently\nsent forces into Wales, and many men thereby grievously\nafflicted, producing no results but destruction of men and waste\nof money.", "A.D. 1097.  In this year was the King William at Christmas in\nNormandy; and afterwards against Easter he embarked for this\nland; for that he thought to hold his court at Winchester; but he\nwas weather-bound until Easter-eve, when he first landed at\nArundel; and for this reason held his court at Windsor.  And\nthereafter with a great army he went into Wales, and quickly\npenetrated that land with his forces, through some of the Welsh\nwho were come to him, and were his guides; and he remained in\nthat country from midsummer nearly until August, and suffered\nmuch loss there in men and in horses, and also in many other\nthings.  The Welshmen, after they had revolted from the king,\nchose them many elders from themselves; one of whom was called\nCadwgan, (124) who was the worthiest of them, being brother's son\nto King Griffin.  And when the king saw that he could do nothing\nin furtherance of his will, he returned again into this land; and\nsoon after that he let his men build castles on the borders.\nThen upon the feast of St. Michael, the fourth day before the\nnones of October, (125) appeared an uncommon star, shining in the\nevening, and soon hastening to set. It (126) was seen south-west,\nand the ray that stood off from it was thought very long, shining\nsouth-east.  And it appeared on this wise nearly all the week.\nMany men supposed that it was a comet.  Soon after this\nArchbishop Anselm of Canterbury obtained leave (127) of the king\n(though it was contrary to the wishes of the king, as men\nsupposed), and went over sea; because he thought that men in this\ncountry did little according to right and after his instruction.\nAnd the king thereafter upon St. Martin's mass went over sea into\nNormandy; but whilst he was waiting for fair weather, his court\nin the county where they lay, did the most harm that ever court\nor army could do in a friendly and peaceable land.  This was in\nall things a very heavy-timed year, and beyond measure laborious\nfrom badness of weather, both when men attempted to till the\nland, and afterwards to gather the fruits of their tilth; and\nfrom unjust contributions they never rested.  Many counties also\nthat were confined to London by work, were grievously oppressed\non account of the wall that they were building about the tower,\nand the bridge that was nearly all afloat, and the work of the\nking's hall that they were building at Westminster; and many men\nperished thereby.  Also in this same year soon after Michaelmas\nwent Edgar Etheling with an army through the king's assistance\ninto Scotland, and with hard fighting won that land, and drove\nout the King Dufnal; and his nephew Edgar, who was son of King\nMalcolm and of Margaret the queen, he there appointed king in\nfealty to the King William; and afterwards again returned to\nEngland.", "A.D. 1098.  In this year at Christmas was the King William in\nNormandy; and Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, and Baldwin, Abbot\nof St. Edmund's, within this tide (128) both departed.  And in\nthis year also died Turold, Abbot of Peterborough.  In the summer\nof this year also, at Finchamstead in Berkshire, a pool welled\nwith blood, as many true men said that should see it.  And Earl\nHugh was slain in Anglesey by foreign pirates, (129) and his\nbrother Robert was his heir, as he had settled it before with the\nking.  Before Michaelmas the heaven was of such an hue, as if it\nwere burning, nearly all the night.  This was a very troublesome\nyear through manifold impositions; and from the abundant rains,\nthat ceased not all the year, nearly all the tilth in the marsh-lands\nperished.", "A.D. 1099.  This year was the King William at midwinter in\nNormandy, and at Easter came hither to land, and at Pentecost\nheld his court the first time in his new building at Westminster;\nand there he gave the bishopric of Durham to Ranulf his chaplain,\nwho had long directed and governed his councils over all England.\nAnd soon after this he went over sea, and drove the Earl Elias\nout of Maine, which he reduced under his power, and so by\nMichaelmas returned to this land.  This year also, on the\nfestival of St. Martin, the sea-flood sprung up to such a height,\nand did so much harm, as no man remembered that it ever did\nbefore.  And this was the first day of the new moon.  And Osmond,\nBishop of Salisbury, died in Advent.", "A.D. 1100.  In this year the King William held his court at\nChristmas in Glocester, and at Easter in Winchester, and at\nPentecost in Westminster.  And at Pentecost was seen in Berkshire\nat a certain town blood to well from the earth; as many said that\nshould see it.  And thereafter on the morning after Lammas day\nwas the King William shot in hunting, by an arrow from his own\nmen, and afterwards brought to Winchester, and buried in the\ncathedral. (130)  This was in the thirteenth year after that he\nassumed the government.  He was very harsh and severe over his\nland and his men, and with all his neighbours; and very\nformidable; and through the counsels of evil men, that to him\nwere always agreeable, and through his own avarice, he was ever\ntiring this nation with an army, and with unjust contributions.\nFor in his days all right fell to the ground, and every wrong\nrose up before God and before the world.  God's church he\nhumbled; and all the bishoprics and abbacies, whose elders fell\nin his days, he either sold in fee, or held in his own hands, and\nlet for a certain sum; because he would be the heir of every man,\nboth of the clergy and laity; so that on the day that he fell he\nhad in his own hand the archbishopric of Canterbury, with the\nbishopric of Winchester, and that of Salisbury, and eleven\nabbacies, all let for a sum; and (though I may be tedious) all\nthat was loathsome to God and righteous men, all that was\ncustomary in this land in his time.  And for this he was loathed\nby nearly all his people, and odious to God, as his end\ntestified:--for he departed in the midst of his\nunrighteousness, without any power of repentance or recompense\nfor his deeds.  On the Thursday he was slain; and in the morning\nafterwards buried; and after he was buried, the statesmen that\nwere then nigh at hand, chose his brother Henry to king.  And he\nimmediately (131) gave the bishopric of Winchester to William\nGiffard; and afterwards went to London; and on the Sunday\nfollowing, before the altar at Westminster, he promised God and\nall the people, to annul all the unrighteous acts that took place\nin his brother's time, and to maintain the best laws that were\nvalid in any king's day before him.  And after this the Bishop of\nLondon, Maurice, consecrated him king; and all in this land\nsubmitted to him, and swore oaths, and became his men.  And the\nking, soon after this, by the advice of those that were about\nhim, allowed men to take the Bishop Ranulf of Durham, and bring\nhim into the Tower of London, and hold him there.  Then, before\nMichaelmas, came the Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury hither to\nthis land; as the King Henry, by the advice of his ministers had\nsent after him, because he had gone out of this land for the\ngreat wrongs that the King William did unto him.  And soon\nhereafter the king took him to wife Maud, daughter of Malcolm,\nKing of Scotland, and of Margaret the good queen, the relative of\nKing Edward, and of the right royal (132) race of England.  And\non Martinmas day she was publicly given to him with much pomp at\nWestminster, and the Archbishop Anselm wedded her to him, and\nafterwards consecrated her queen.  And the Archbishop Thomas of\nYork soon hereafter died.  During the harvest of this same year\nalso came the Earl Robert home into Normandy, and the Earl Robert\nof Flanders, Eustace, Earl of Boulogne, from Jerusalem.  And as\nsoon as the Earl Robert came into Normandy, he was joyfully\nreceived by all his people; except those of the castles that were\ngarrisoned with the King Henry's men.  Against them he had many\ncontests and struggles.", "A.D. 1101.  In this year at Christmas held the King Henry his\ncourt in Westminster, and at Easter in Winchester.  And soon\nthereafter were the chief men in this land in a conspiracy\nagainst the king; partly from their own great infidelity, and\nalso through the Earl Robert of Normandy, who with hostility\naspired to the invasion of this land.  And the king afterwards\nsent ships out to sea, to thwart and impede his brother; but some\nof them in the time of need fell back, and turned from the king,\nand surrendered themselves to the Earl Robert.  Then at midsummer\nwent the king out to Pevensey with all his force against his\nbrother, and there awaited him.  But in the meantime came the\nEarl Robert up at Portsmouth twelve nights before Lammas; and the\nking with all his force came against him.  But the chief men\ninterceded between them, and settled the brothers on the\ncondition, \"that the king should forego all that he held by main\nstrength in Normandy against the earl; and that all then in\nEngland should have their lands again, who had lost it before\nthrough the earl, and Earl Eustace also all his patrimony in this\nland; and that the Earl Robert every year should receive from\nEngland three thousand marks of silver; and particularly, that\nwhichever of the brothers should survive the other, he should be\nheir of all England and also of Normandy, except the deceased\nleft an heir by lawful wedlock.\"  And this twelve men of the\nhighest rank on either side then confirmed with an oath.  And the\nearl afterwards remained in this land till after Michaelmas; and\nhis men did much harm wherever they went, the while that the earl\ncontinued in this land.  This year also the Bishop Ranulf at\nCandlemas burst out of the Tower of London by night, where he was\nin confinement, and went into Normandy; through whose contrivance\nand instigation mostly the Earl Robert this year sought this land\nwith hostility.", "A.D. 1102.  In this year at the Nativity was the King Henry at\nWestminster, and at Easter in Winchester.  And soon thereafter\narose a dissention between the king and the Earl Robert of\nBelesme, who held in this land the earldom of Shrewsbury, that\nhis father, Earl Roger, had before, and much territory therewith\nboth on this side and beyond the sea.  And the king went and\nbeset the castle at Arundel; but when he could not easily win it,\nhe allowed men to make castles before it, and filled them with\nhis men; and afterwards with all his army he went to Bridgenorth,\nand there continued until he had the castle, and deprived the\nEarl Robert of his land, and stripped him of all that he had in\nEngland.  And the earl accordingly went over sea, and the army\nafterwards returned home.  Then was the king thereafter by\nMichaelmas at Westminster; and all the principal men in this\nland, clerk, and laity.  And the Archbishop Anselm held a synod\nof clergy; and there they established many canons that belong to\nChristianity.  And many, both French and English, were there\ndeprived of their staves and dignity, which they either obtained\nwith injustice, or enjoyed with dishonour.  And in this same\nyear, in the week of the feast of Pentecost, there came thieves,\nsome from Auvergne, (133) some from France, and some from\nFlanders, and broke into the minster of Peterborough, and therein\nseized much property in gold and in silver; namely, roods, and\nchalices, and candlesticks.", "A.D. 1103.  In this year, at midwinter, was the King Henry at\nWestminster.  And soon afterwards departed the Bishop William\nGiffard out of this land; because he would not against right\naccept his hood at the hands of the Archbishop Gerard of York.\nAnd then at Easter held the king his court at Winchester, and\nafterwards went the Archbishop Anselm from Canterbury to Rome, as\nwas agreed between him and the king.  This year also came the\nEarl Robert of Normandy to speak with the king in this land; and\nere he departed hence he forgave the King Henry the three\nthousand marks that he was bound by treaty to give him each year.\nIn this year also at Hamstead in Berkshire was seen blood [to\nrise] from the earth.  This was a very calamitous year in this\nland, through manifold impositions, and through murrain of\ncattle, and deficiency of produce, not only in corn, but in every\nkind of fruit.  Also in the morning, upon the mass day of St.\nLaurence, the wind did so much harm here on land to all fruits,\nas no man remembered that ever any did before.  In this same year\ndied Matthias, Abbot of Peterborough, who lived no longer than\none year after he was abbot.  After Michaelmas, on the twelfth\nday before the calends of November, he was in full procession\nreceived as abbot; and on the same day of the next year he was\ndead at Glocester, and there buried.", "A.D. 1104.  In this year at Christmas held the King Henry his\ncourt at Westminster, and at Easter in Winchester, and at\nPentecost again at Westminster.  This year was the first day of\nPentecost on the nones of June; and on the Tuesday following were\nseen four circles at mid-day about the sun, of a white hue, each\ndescribed under the other as if they were measured.  All that saw\nit wondered; for they never remembered such before.  Afterwards\nwere reconciled the Earl Robert of Normandy and Robert de\nBelesme, whom the King Henry had before deprived of his lands,\nand driven from England; and through their reconciliation the\nKing of England and the Earl of Normandy became adversaries.  And\nthe king sent his folk over sea into Normandy; and the head-men\nin that land received them, and with treachery to their lord, the\nearl, lodged them in their castles, whence they committed many\noutrages on the earl in plundering and burning.  This year also\nWilliam, Earl of Moreton (134) went from this land into Normandy;\nbut after he was gone he acted against the king; because the king\nstripped and deprived him of all that he had here in this land.\nIt is not easy to describe the misery of this land, which it was\nsuffering through various and manifold wrongs and impositions,\nthat never failed nor ceased; and wheresoever the king went,\nthere was full licence given to his company to harrow and oppress\nhis wretched people; and in the midst thereof happened oftentimes\nburnings and manslaughter.  All this was done to the displeasure\nof God, and to the vexation of this unhappy people.", "A.D. 1105.  In this year, on the Nativity, held the King Henry\nhis court at Windsor; and afterwards in Lent he went over sea\ninto Normandy against his brother Earl Robert.  And whilst he\nremained there he won of his brother Caen and Baieux; and almost\nall the castles and the chief men in that land were subdued.  And\nafterwards by harvest he returned hither again; and that which he\nhad won in Normandy remained afterwards in peace and subjection\nto him; except that which was anywhere near the Earl William of\nMoretaine.  This he often demanded as strongly as he could for\nthe loss of his land in this country.  And then before Christmas\ncame Robert de Belesme hither to the king.  This was a very\ncalamitous year in this land, through loss of fruits, and through\nthe manifold contributions, that never ceased before the king\nwent over [to Normandy], or while he was there, or after he came\nback again.", "A.D. 1106.  In this year was the King Henry on the Nativity at\nWestminster, and there held his court; and at that season Robert\nde Belesme went unreconciled from the king out of his land into\nNormandy.  Hereafter before Lent was the king at Northampton; and\nthe Earl Robert his brother came thither from Normandy to him;\nand because the king would not give him back that which he had\ntaken from him in Normandy, they parted in hostility; and the\nearl soon went over sea back again.  In the first week of Lent,\non the Friday, which was the fourteenth before the calends of\nMarch, in the evening appeared an unusual star; and a long time\nafterwards was seen every evening shining awhile.  The star\nappeared in the south-west; it was thought little and dark; but\nthe train of light which stood from it was very bright, and\nappeared like an immense beam shining north-east; and some\nevening this beam was seen as if it were moving itself forwards\nagainst the star.  Some said that they saw more of such unusual\nstars at this time; but we do not write more fully about it,\nbecause we saw it not ourselves.  On the night preceding the\nLord's Supper, (135) that is, the Thursday before Easter, were\nseen two moons in the heavens before day, the one in the east,\nand the other in the west, both full; and it was the fourteenth\nday of the moon.  At Easter was the king at Bath, and at\nPentecost at Salisbury; because he would not hold his court when\nhe was beyond the sea.  After this, and before August, went the\nking over sea into Normandy; and almost all that were in that\nland submitted to his will, except Robert de Belesme and the Earl\nof Moretaine, and a few others of the principal persons who yet\nheld with the Earl of Normandy.  For this reason the king\nafterwards advanced with an army, and beset a castle of the Earl\nof Moretaine, called Tenerchebrai. (136)  Whilst the king beset\nthe castle, came the Earl Robert of Normandy on Michaelmas eve\nagainst the king with his army, and with him Robert of Belesme,\nand William, Earl of Moretaine, and all that would be with them;\nbut the strength and the victory were the king's.  There was the\nEarl of Normandy taken, and the Earl of Moretaine, and Robert of\nStutteville, and afterwards sent to England, and put into\ncustody.  Robert of Belesme was there put to flight, and William\nCrispin was taken, and many others forthwith.  Edgar Etheling,\nwho a little before had gone over from the king to the earl, was\nalso there taken, whom the king afterwards let go unpunished.\nThen went the king over all that was in Normandy, and settled it\naccording to his will and discretion.  This year also were heavy\nand sinful conflicts between the Emperor of Saxony and his son,\nand in the midst of these conflicts the father fell, and the son\nsucceeded to the empire.", "A.D. 1107.  In this year at Christmas was the King Henry in\nNormandy; and, having disposed and settled that land to his will,\nhe afterwards came hither in Lent, and at Easter held his court\nat Windsor, and at Pentecost in Westminster.  And afterwards in\nthe beginning of August he was again at Westminster, and there\ngave away and settled the bishoprics and abbacies that either in\nEngland or in Normandy were without elders and pastors.  Of these\nthere were so many, that there was no man who remembered that\never so many together were given away before.  And on this same\noccasion, among the others who accepted abbacies, Ernulf, who\nbefore was prior at Canterbury, succeeded to the abbacy in\nPeterborough.  This was nearly about seven years after the King\nHenry undertook the kingdom, and the one and fortieth year since\nthe Franks governed this land.  Many said that they saw sundry\ntokens in the moon this year, and its orb increasing and\ndecreasing contrary to nature.  This year died Maurice, Bishop of\nLondon, and Robert, Abbot of St. Edmund's bury, and Richard,\nAbbot of Ely.  This year also died the King Edgar in Scotland, on\nthe ides of January, and Alexander his brother succeeded to the\nkingdom, as the King Henry granted him.", "A.D. 1108.  In this year was the King Henry on the Nativity at\nWestminster, and at Easter at Winchester, and by Pentecost at\nWestminster again.  After this, before August, he went into\nNormandy.  And Philip, the King of France, died on the nones of\nAugust, and his son Louis succeeded to the kingdom.  And there\nwere afterwards many struggles between the King of France and the\nKing of England, while the latter remained in Normandy.  In this\nyear also died the Archbishop Girard of York, before Pentecost,\nand Thomas was afterwards appointed thereto.", "A.D. 1109.  In this year was the King Henry at Christmas and at\nEaster in Normandy; and before Pentecost he came to this land,\nand held his court at Westminster.  There were the conditions\nfully settled, and the oaths sworn, for giving his daughter (137)\nto the emperor. (138)  This year were very frequent storms of\nthunder, and very tremendous; and the Archbishop Anselm of\nCanterbury died on the eleventh day before the calends of April;\nand the first day of Easter was on \"Litania major\".", "A.D. 1110.  In this year held the King Henry his court at\nChristmas in Westminster, and at Easter he was at Marlborough,\nand at Pentecost he held his court for the first time in New\nWindsor.  This year before Lent the king sent his daughter with\nmanifold treasures over sea, and gave her to the emperor.  On the\nfifth night in the month of May appeared the moon shining bright\nin the evening, and afterwards by little and little its light\ndiminished, so that, as soon as night came, (139) it was so\ncompletely extinguished withal, that neither light, nor orb, nor\nanything at all of it was seen.  And so it continued nearly until\nday, and then appeared shining full and bright.  It was this same\nday a fortnight old.  All the night was the firmament very clear,\nand the stars over all the heavens shining very bright.  And the\nfruits of the trees were this night sorely nipt by frost.\nAfterwards, in the month of June, appeared a star north-east, and\nits train stood before it towards the south-west.  Thus was it\nseen many nights; and as the night advanced, when it rose higher,\nit was seen going backward toward the north-west.  This year were\ndeprived of their lands Philip of Braiose, and William Mallet,\nand William Bainard.  This year also died Earl Elias, who held\nMaine in fee-tail (140) of King Henry; and after his death the\nEarl of Anjou succeeded to it, and held it against the king.\nThis was a very calamitous year in this land, through the\ncontributions which the king received for his daughter's portion,\nand through the badness of the weather, by which the fruits of\nthe earth were very much marred, and the produce of the trees\nover all this land almost entirely perished.  This year men began\nfirst to work at the new minster at Chertsey.", "A.D. 1111.  This year the King Henry bare not his crown at\nChristmas, nor at Easter, nor at Pentecost.  And in August he\nwent over sea into Normandy, on account of the broils that some\nhad with him by the confines of France, and chiefly on account of\nthe Earl of Anjou, who held Maine against him.  And after he came\nover thither, many conspiracies, and burnings, and harrowings,\ndid they between them.  In this year died the Earl Robert of\nFlanders, and his son Baldwin succeeded thereto. (141)  This year\nwas the winter very long, and the season heavy and severe; and\nthrough that were the fruits of the earth sorely marred, and\nthere was the greatest murrain of cattle that any man could\nremember.", "A.D. 1112.  All this year remained the King Henry in Normandy on\naccount of the broils that he had with France, and with the Earl\nof Anjou, who held Maine against him.  And whilst he was there,\nhe deprived of their lands the Earl of Evreux, and William\nCrispin, and drove them out of Normandy.  To Philip of Braiose he\nrestored his land, who had been before deprived of it; and Robert\nof Belesme he suffered to be seized, and put into prison.  This\nwas a very good year, and very fruitful, in wood and in field;\nbut it was a very heavy time and sorrowful, through a severe\nmortality amongst men.", "A.D. 1113.  In this year was the King Henry on the Nativity and\nat Easter and at Pentecost in Normandy.  And after that, in the\nsummer, he sent hither Robert of Belesme into the castle at\nWareham, and himself soon (142) afterwards came hither to this\nland.", "A.D. 1114.  In this year held the King Henry his court on the\nNativity at Windsor, and held no other court afterwards during\nthe year.  And at midsummer he went with an army into Wales; and\nthe Welsh came and made peace with the king.  And he let men\nbuild castles therein.  And thereafter, in September, he went\nover sea into Normandy.  This year, in the latter end of May, was\nseen an uncommon star with a long train, shining many nights.  In\nthis year also was so great an ebb of the tide everywhere in one\nday, as no man remembered before; so that men went riding and\nwalking over the Thames eastward of London bridge.  This year\nwere very violent winds in the month of October; but it was\nimmoderately rough in the night of the octave of St. Martin; and\nthat was everywhere manifest both in town and country.  In this\nyear also the king gave the archbishopric of Canterbury to Ralph,\nwho was before Bishop of Rochester; and Thomas, Archbishop of\nYork, died; and Turstein succeeded thereto, who was before the\nking's chaplain.  About this same time went the king toward the\nsea, and was desirous of going over, but the weather prevented\nhim; then meanwhile sent he his writ after the Abbot Ernulf of\nPeterborough, and bade that he should come to him quickly, for\nthat he wished to speak with him on an interesting subject.  When\nhe came to him, he appointed him to the bishopric of Rochester;\nand the archbishops and bishops and all the nobility that were in\nEngland coincided with the king.  And he long withstood, but it\navailed nothing.  And the king bade the archbishop that he should\nlead him to Canterbury, and consecrate him bishop whether he\nwould or not. (143)  This was done in the town called Bourne\n(144) on the seventeenth day before the calends of October.  When\nthe monks of Peterborough heard of this, they felt greater sorrow\nthan they had ever experienced before; because he was a very good\nand amiable man, and did much good within and without whilst he\nabode there.  God Almighty abide ever with him.  Soon after this\ngave the king the abbacy to a monk of Sieyes, whose name was\nJohn, through the intreaty of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  And\nsoon after this the king and the Archbishop of Canterbury sent\nhim to Rome after the archbishop's pall; and a monk also with\nhim, whose name was Warner, and the Archdeacon John, the nephew\nof the archbishop.  And they sped well there.  This was done on\nthe seventh day before the calends Of October, in the town that\nis yclept Rowner.  And this same day went the king on board ship\nat Portsmouth.", "A.D. 1115.  This year was the King Henry on the Nativity in\nNormandy.  And whilst he was there, he contrived that all the\nhead men in Normandy did homage and fealty to his son William,\nwhom he had by his queen.  And after this, in the month of July,\nhe returned to this land.  This year was the winter so severe,\nwith snow and with frost, that no man who was then living ever\nremembered one more severe; in consequence of which there was\ngreat destruction of cattle.  During this year the Pope Paschalis\nsent the pall into this land to Ralph, Archbishop of Canterbury;\nand he received it with great worship at his archiepiscopal stall\nin Canterbury.  It was brought hither from Rome by Abbot Anselm,\nwho was the nephew of Archbishop Anselm, and the Abbot John of\nPeterborough.", "A.D. 1116.  In this year was the King Henry on the Nativity at\nSt. Alban's, where he permitted the consecration of that\nmonastery; and at Easter he was at Odiham.  And there was also\nthis year a very heavy-timed winter, strong and long, for cattle\nand for all things.  And the king soon after Easter went over sea\ninto Normandy.  And there were many conspiracies and robberies,\nand castles taken betwixt France and Normandy.  Most of this\ndisturbance was because the King Henry assisted his nephew,\nTheobald de Blois, who was engaged in a war against his lord,\nLouis, the King of France.  This was a very vexatious and\ndestructive year with respect to the fruits of the earth, through\nthe immoderate rains that fell soon after the beginning of\nAugust, harassing and perplexing men till Candlemas-day.  This\nyear also was so deficient in mast, that there was never heard\nsuch in all this land or in Wales.  This land and nation were\nalso this year oft and sorely swincked by the guilds which the\nking took both within the boroughs and without.  In this same\nyear was consumed by fire the whole monastery of Peterborough,\nand all the buildings, except the chapter-house and the\ndormitory, and therewith also all the greater part of the town.\nAll this happened on a Friday, which was the second day before\nthe nones of August.", "A.D. 1117.  All this year remained the King Henry, in Normandy,\non account of the hostility of the King of France and his other\nneighbours.  And in the summer came the King of France and the\nEarl of Flanders with him with an army into Normandy.  And having\nstayed therein one night, they returned again in the morning\nwithout fighting.  But Normandy was very much afflicted both by\nthe exactions and by the armies which the King Henry collected\nagainst them.  This nation also was severely oppressed through\nthe same means, namely, through manifold exactions.  This year\nalso, in the night of the calends of December, were immoderate\nstorms with thunder, and lightning, and rain, and hail.  And in\nthe night of the third day before the ides of December was the\nmoon, during a long time of the night, as if covered with blood,\nand afterwards eclipsed.  Also in the night of the seventeenth\nday before the calends of January, was the heaven seen very red,\nas if it were burning.  And on the octave of St. John the\nEvangelist was the great earthquake in Lombardy; from the shock\nof which many minsters, and towers, and houses fell, and did much\nharm to men.  This was a very blighted year in corn, through the\nrains that scarcely ceased for nearly all the year.  And the\nAbbot Gilbert of Westminster died on the eighth day before the\nides of December; and Faritz, Abbot of Abingdon, on the seventh\nday before the calends of March.  And in this same year....", "A.D. 1118.  All this year abode the King Henry in Normandy on\naccount of the war of the King of France and the Earl of Anjou,\nand the Earl of Flanders.  And the Earl of Flanders was wounded\nin Normandy, and went so wounded into Flanders.  By this war was\nthe king much exhausted, and he was a great loser both in land\nand money.  And his own men grieved him most, who often from him\nturned, and betrayed him; and going over to his foes surrendered\nto them their castles, to the injury and disappointment of the\nking.  All this England dearly bought through the manifold guilds\nthat all this year abated not.  This year, in the week of the\nEpiphany, there was one evening a great deal of lightning, and\nthereafter unusual thunder.  And the Queen Matilda died at\nWestminster on the calends of May; and there was buried.  And the\nEarl Robert of Mellent died also this year.  In this year also,\non the feast of St. Thomas, was so very immoderately violent a\nwind, that no man who was then living ever remembered any\ngreater; and that was everywhere seen both in houses and also in\ntrees.  This year also died Pope Paschalis; and John of Gaeta\nsucceeded to the popedom, whose other name was Gelasius.", "A.D. 1119.  All this year continued the King Henry in Normandy;\nand he was greatly perplexed by the hostility of the King of\nFrance, and also of his own men, who with treachery deserted from\nhim, and oft readily betrayed him; until the two kings came\ntogether in Normandy with their forces.  There was the King of\nFrance put to flight, and all his best men taken.  And afterwards\nmany of King Henry's men returned to him, and accorded with him,\nwho were before, with their castellans, against him.  And some of\nthe castles he took by main strength.  This year went William,\nthe son of King Henry and Queen Matilda, into Normandy to his\nfather, and there was given to him, and wedded to wife, the\ndaughter of the Earl of Anjou.  On the eve of the mass of St.\nMichael was much earth-heaving in some places in this land;\nthough most of all in Glocestershire and in Worcestershire.  In\nthis same year died the Pope Gelasius, on this side of the Alps,\nand was buried at Clugny.  And after him the Archbishop of Vienna\nwas chosen pope, whose name was Calixtus.  He afterwards, on the\nfestival of St. Luke the Evangelist, came into France to Rheims,\nand there held a council.  And the Archbishop Turstin of York\nwent thither; and, because that he against right, and against the\narchiepiscopal stall in Canterbury, and against the king's will,\nreceived his hood at the hands of the pope, the king interdicted\nhim from all return to England.  And thus he lost his\narchbishopric, and with the pope went towards Rome.  In this year\nalso died the Earl Baldwin of Flanders of the wounds that he\nreceived in Normandy.  And after him succeeded to the earldom\nCharles, the son of his uncle by the father's side, who was son\nof Cnute, the holy King of Denmark.", "A.D. 1120.  This year were reconciled the King of England and the\nKing of France; and after their reconciliation all the King\nHenry's own men accorded with him in Normandy, as well as the\nEarl of Flanders and the Earl of Ponthieu.  From this time\nforward the King Henry settled his castles and his land in\nNormandy after his will; and so before Advent came to this land.\nAnd in this expedition were drowned the king's two sons, William\nand Richard, and Richard, Earl of Chester, and Ottuel his\nbrother, and very many of the king's household, stewards, and\nchamberlains, and butlers, and men of various abodes; and with\nthem a countless multidude of very incomparable folk besides.\nSore was their death to their friends in a twofold respect: one,\nthat they so suddenly lost this life; the other, that few of\ntheir bodies were found anywhere afterwards.  This year came that\nlight to the sepulchre of the Lord in Jerusalem twice; once at\nEaster, and the other on the assumption of St. Mary, as credible\npersons said who came thence.  And the Archbishop Turstin of York\nwas through the pope reconciled with the king, and came to this\nland, and recovered his bishopric, though it was very undesirable\nto the Archbishop of Canterbury.", "A.D. 1121.  This year was the King Henry at Christmas at Bramton,\nand afterwards, before Candlemas, at Windsor was given him to\nwife Athelis; soon afterwards consecrated queen, who was daughter\nof the Duke of Louvain.  And the moon was eclipsed in the night\nof the nones of April, being a fortnight old.  And the king was\nat Easter at Berkley; and after that at Pentecost he held a full\ncourt at Westminster; and afterwards in the summer went with an\narmy into Wales.  And the Welsh came against him; and after the\nking's will they accorded with him.  This year came the Earl of\nAnjou from Jerusalem into his land; and soon after sent hither to\nfetch his daughter, who had been given to wife to William, the\nking's son.  And in the night of the eve of \"Natalis Domini\" was\na very violent wind over all this land, and that was in many\nthings evidently seen.", "A.D. 1122.  In this year was the King Henry at Christmas in\nNorwich, and at Easter in Northampton.  And in the Lent-tide\nbefore that, the town of Glocester was on fire: the while that\nthe monks were singing their mass, and the deacon had begun the\ngospel, \"Praeteriens Jesus\", at that very moment came the fire\nfrom the upper part of the steeple, and burned all the minster,\nand all the treasures that were there within; except a few books,\nand three mass-hackles.  That was on the eighth day before the\nides of Marcia.  And thereafter, the Tuesday after Palm-Sunday,\nwas a very violent wind on the eleventh day before the calends of\nApril; after which came many tokens far and wide in England, and\nmany spectres were both seen and heard.  And the eighth night\nbefore the calends of August was a very violent earthquake over\nall Somersetshire, and in Glocestershire.  Soon after, on the\nsixth day before the ides of September, which was on the festival\nof St. Mary, (145) there was a very violent wind from the fore\npart of the day to the depth of the night.  This same year died\nRalph, the Archbishop of Canterbury; that was on the thirteenth\nday before the calends of November.  After this there were many\nshipmen on the sea, and on fresh water, who said, that they saw\non the north-east, level with the earth, a fire huge and broad,\nwhich anon waxed in length up to the welkin; and the welkin undid\nitself in four parts, and fought against it, as if it would\nquench it; and the fire waxed nevertheless up to the heaven.  The\nfire they saw in the day-dawn; and it lasted until it was light\nover all.  That was on the seventh day before the ides of\nDecember.", "A.D. 1123.  In this year was the King Henry, at Christmastide at\nDunstable, and there came to him the ambassadors of the Earl of\nAnjou.  And thence he went to Woodstock; and his bishops and his\nwhole court with him.  Then did it betide on a Wednesday, which\nwas on the fourth day before the ides of January, that the king\nrode in his deer-fold; (146) the Bishop Roger of Salisbury (147)\non one side of him, and the Bishop Robert Bloet of Lincoln on the\nother side of him.  And they rode there talking together.  Then\nsank down the Bishop of Lincoln, and said to the king, \"Lord\nking, I die.\"  And the king alighted down from his horse, and\nlifted him betwixt his arms, and let men bear him home to his\ninn.  There he was soon dead; and they carried him to Lincoln\nwith great worship, and buried him before the altar of St. Mary.\nAnd the Bishop of Chester, whose name was Robert Pecceth, buried\nhim.  Soon after this sent the king his writ over all England,\nand bade all his bishops and his abbots and his thanes, that they\nshould come to his wittenmoot on Candlemas day at Glocester to\nmeet him: and they did so.  When they were there gathered\ntogether, then the king bade them, that they should choose for\nthemselves an Archbishop of Canterbury, whomsoever they would,\nand he would confirm it.  Then spoke the bishops among\nthemselves, and said that they never more would have a man of the\nmonastic order as archbishop over them.  And they went all in a\nbody to the king, and earnestly requested that they might choose\nfrom the clerical order whomsoever they would for archbishop.\nAnd the king granted it to them.  This was all concerted before,\nthrough the Bishop of Salisbury, and through the Bishop of\nLincoln ere he was dead; for that they never loved the rule of\nmonks, but were ever against monks and their rule.  And the prior\nand the monks of Canterbury, and all the other persons of the\nmonastic order that were there, withstood it full two days; but\nit availed nought: for the Bishop of Salisbury was strong, and\nwielded all England, and opposed them with all his power and\nmight.  Then chose they a clerk, named William of Curboil.  He\nwas canon of a monastery called Chiche. (148)  And they brought\nhim before the king; and the king gave him the archbishopric.\nAnd all the bishops received him: but almost all the monks, and\nthe earls, and the thanes that were there, protested against him.\nAbout the same time departed the earl's messengers (149) in\nhostility from the king, reckless of his favour.  During the same\ntime came a legate from Rome, whose name was Henry.  He was abbot\nof the monastery of St. John of Angeli; and he came after the\nRome-scot.  And he said to the king, that it was against right\nthat men should set a clerk over monks; and therefore they had\nchosen an archbishop before in their chapter after right.  But\nthe king would not undo it, for the love of the Bishop of\nSalisbury.  Then went the archbishop, soon after this, to\nCanterbury; and was there received, though it was against their\nwill; and he was there soon blessed to bishop by the Bishop of\nLondon, and the Bishop Ernulf of Rochester, and the Bishop\nWilliam Girard of Winchester, and the Bishop Bernard of Wales,\nand the Bishop Roger of Salisbury.  Then, early in Lent, went\nthe archbishop to Rome, after his pall; and with him went the\nBishop Bernard of Wales; and Sefred, Abbot of Glastonbury; and\nAnselm, Abbot of St. Edmund's bury; and John, Archdeacon of\nCanterbury; and Gifard, who was the king's court-chaplain.  At\nthe same time went the Archbishop Thurstan of York to Rome,\nthrough the behest of the pope, and came thither three days ere\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury came, and was there received with\nmuch worship.  Then came the Archbishop of Canterbury, and was\nthere full seven nights ere they could come to a conference with\nthe pope.  That was, because the pope was made to understand that\nhe had obtained the archbishopric against the monks of the\nminster, and against right.  But that overcame Rome, which\novercometh all the world; that is, gold and silver.  And the pope\nsoftened, and gave him his pall.  And the archbishop (of York)\nswore him subjection, in all those things, which the pope\nenjoined him, by the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul; and the\npope then sent him home with his blessing.  The while that the\narchbishop was out of the land, the king gave the bishopric of\nBath to the Queen's chancellor, whose name was Godfrey.  He was\nborn in Louvain.  That was on the Annunciation of St. Mary, at\nWoodstock.  Soon after this went the king to Winchester, and was\nall Easter-tide there.  And the while that he was there, gave he\nthe bishopric of Lincoln to a clerk hight Alexander.  He was\nnephew of the Bishop of Salisbury.  This he did all for the love\nof the bishop.  Then went the king thence to Portsmouth, and lay\nthere all over Pentecost week.  Then, as soon as he had a fair\nwind, he went over into Normandy; and meanwhile committed all\nEngland to the guidance and government of the Bishop Roger of\nSalisbury.  Then was the king all this year (150) in Normandy.\nAnd much hostility arose betwixt him and his thanes; so that the\nEarl Waleram of Mellent, and Hamalric, and Hugh of Montfort, and\nWilliam of Romare, and many others, went from him, and held their\ncastles against him.  And the king strongly opposed them: and\nthis same year he won of Waleram his castle of Pont-Audemer, and\nof Hugh that of Montfort; and ever after, the longer he stayed,\nthe better he sped.  This same year, ere the Bishop of Lincoln\ncame to his bishopric, almost all the borough of Lincoln was\nburned, and numberless folks, men and women, were consumed: and\nso much harm was there done as no man could describe to another.\nThat was on the fourteenth day before the calends of June.", "A.D. 1124.  All this year was the King Henry in Normandy.  That\nwas for the great hostility that he had with the King Louis of\nFrance, and with the Earl of Anjou, and most of all with his own\nmen.  Then it happened, on the day of the Annunciation of St.\nMary, that the Earl Waleram of Mellent went from one of his\ncastles called Belmont to another called Watteville.  With him\nwent the steward of the King of France, Amalric, and Hugh the son\nof Gervase, and Hugh of Montfort, and many other good knights.\nThen came against them the king's knights from all the castles\nthat were thereabout, and fought with them, and put them to\nflight, and took the Earl Waleram, and Hugh, the son of Gervase,\nand Hugh of Montfort, and five and twenty other knights, and\nbrought them to the king.  And the king committed the Earl\nWaleram, and Hugh, the son of Gervase, to close custody in the\ncastle at Rouen; but Hugh of Montfort he sent to England, and\nordered him to be secured with strong bonds in the castle at\nGlocester.  And of the others as many as he chose he sent north\nand south to his castles in captivity.  After this went the king,\nand won all the castles of the Earl Waleram that were in\nNormandy, and all the others that his enemies held against him.\nAll this hostility was on account of the son of the Earl Robert\nof Normandy, named William.  This same William had taken to wife\nthe younger daughter of Fulke, Earl of Anjou: and for this reason\nthe King of France and all the earls held with him, and all the\nrich men; and said that the king held his brother Robert\nwrongfully in captivity, and drove his son William unjustly out\nof Normandy.  This same year were the seasons very unfavourable\nin England for corn and all fruits; so that between Christmas and\nCandlemas men sold the acre-seed of wheat, that is two seedlips,\nfor six shillings; and the barley, that is three seedlips, for\nsix shillings also; and the acre-seed of oats, that is four\nseedlips, for four shillings.  That was because that corn was\nscarce; and the penny was so adulterated, (151) that a man who\nhad a pound at a market could not exchange twelve pence thereof\nfor anything.  In this same year died the blessed Bishop Ernulf\nof Rochester, who before was Abbot of Peterborough.  That was on\nthe ides of March.  And after this died the King Alexander of\nScotland, on the ninth day before the calends of May.  And David\nhis brother, who was Earl of Northamptonshire, succeeded to the\nkingdom; and had both together, the kingdom of Scotland and the\nearldom in England.  And on the nineteenth day before the calends\nof January died the Pope of Rome, whose name was Calixtus, and\nHonorius succeeded to the popedom.  This same year, after St.\nAndrew's mass, and before Christmas, held Ralph Basset and the\nking's thanes a wittenmoot in Leicestershire, at Huncothoe, and\nthere hanged more thieves than ever were known before; that is,\nin a little while, four and forty men altogether; and despoiled\nsix men of their eyes and of their testicles.  Many true men said\nthat there were several who suffered very unjustly; but our Lord\nGod Almighty, who seeth and knoweth every secret, seeth also that\nthe wretched people are oppressed with all unrighteousness.\nFirst they are bereaved of their property, and then they are\nslain.  Full heavy year was this.  The man that had any property,\nwas bereaved of it by violent guilds and violent moots.  The man\nthat had not, was starved with hunger.", "A.D. 1125.  In this year sent the King Henry, before Christmas,\nfrom Normandy to England, and bade that all the mint-men that\nwere in England should be mutilated in their limbs; that was,\nthat they should lose each of them the right hand, and their\ntesticles beneath.  This was because the man that had a pound\ncould not lay out a penny at a market.  And the Bishop Roger of\nSalisbury sent over all England, and bade them all that they\nshould come to Winchester at Christmas.  When they came thither,\nthen were they taken one by one, and deprived each of the right\nhand and the testicles beneath.  All this was done within the\ntwelfth-night.  And that was all in perfect justice, because that\nthey had undone all the land with the great quantity of base coin\nthat they all bought.  In this same year sent the Pope of Rome to\nthis land a cardinal, named John of Crema.  He came first to the\nking in Normandy, and the king received him with much worship.\nHe betook himself then to the Archbishop William of Canterbury;\nand he led him to Canterbury; and he was there received with\ngreat veneration, and in solemn procession.  And he sang the high\nmass on Easter day at the altar of Christ.  Afterwards he went\nover all England, to all the bishoprics and abbacies that were in\nthis land; and in all he was received with respect.  And all gave\nhim many and rich gifts.  And afterwards he held his council in\nLondon full three days, on the Nativity of St. Mary in September,\nwith archbishops, and diocesan bishops, and abbots, the learned\nand the lewd; (152) and enjoined there the same laws that\nArchbishop Anselm had formerly enjoined, and many more, though it\navailed little.  Thence he went over sea soon after Michaelmas,\nand so to Rome; and (with him) the Archbishop William of\nCanterbury, and the Archbishop Thurstan of York, and the Bishop\nAlexander of Lincoln, and the Bishop J. of Lothian, and the Abbot\nG. of St. Alban's; and were there received by the Pope Honorius\nwith great respect; and continued there all the winter.  In this\nsame year was so great a flood on St. Laurence's day, that many\ntowns and men were overwhelmed, and bridges broken down, and corn\nand meadows spoiled withal; and hunger and qualm (153) in men and\nin cattle; and in all fruits such unseasonableness as was not\nknown for many years before.  And this same year died the Abbot\nJohn of Peterborough, on the second day before the ides of\nOctober.", "A.D. 1126.  All this year was the King Henry in Normandy--all\ntill after harvest.  Then came he to this land, betwixt the\nNativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas.  With him came the queen,\nand his daughter, whom he had formerly given to the Emperor Henry\nof Lorrain to wife.  And he brought with him the Earl Waleram,\nand Hugh, the son of Gervase.  And the earl he sent to\nBridgenorth in captivity: and thence he sent him afterwards to\nWallingford; and Hugh to Windsor, whom he ordered to be kept in\nstrong bonds.  Then after Michaelmas came David, the king of the\nScots, from Scotland to this land; and the King Henry received\nhim with great worship; and he continued all that year in this\nland.  In this year the king had his brother Robert taken from\nthe Bishop Roger of Salisbury, and committed him to his son\nRobert, Earl of Glocester, and had him led to Bristol, and there\nput into the castle.  That was all done through his daughter's\ncounsel, and through David, the king of the Scots, her uncle.", "A.D. 1127.  This year held the King Henry his court at Christmas\nin Windsor.  There was David the king of the Scots, and all the\nhead men that were in England, learned and lewd.  And there he\nengaged the archbishops, and bishops, and abbots, and earls, and\nall the thanes that were there, to swear England and Normandy\nafter his day into the hands of his daughter Athelicia, who was\nformerly the wife of the Emperor of Saxony.  Afterwards he sent\nher to Normandy; and with her went her brother Robert, Earl of\nGlocester, and Brian, son of the Earl Alan Fergan; (154) and he\nlet her wed the son of the Earl of Anjou, whose name was Geoffry\nMartel.  All the French and English, however, disapproved of\nthis; but the king did it for to have the alliance of the Earl\nof Anjou, and for to have help against his nephew William.  In\nthe Lent-tide of this same year was the Earl Charles of Flanders\nslain in a church, as he lay there and prayed to God, before the\naltar, in the midst of the mass, by his own men.  And the King of\nFrance brought William, the son of the Earl of Normandy, and gave\nhim the earldom; and the people of that land accepted him.  This\nsame William had before taken to wife the daughter of the Earl of\nAnjou; but they were afterwards divorced on the plea of\nconsanguinity.  This was all through the King Henry of England.\nAfterwards took he to wife the sister of the king's wife of\nFrance; and for this reason the king gave him the earldom of\nFlanders.  This same year he (155) gave the abbacy of\nPeterborough to an abbot named Henry of Poitou, who retained in\nhand his abbacy of St. John of Angeli; but all the archbishops\nand bishops said that it was against right, and that he could not\nhave two abbacies on hand.  But the same Henry gave the king to\nunderstand, that he had relinquished his abbacy on account of the\ngreat hostility that was in the land; and that he did through the\ncounsel and leave of the Pope of Rome, and through that of the\nAbbot of Clugny, and because he was legate of the Rome-scot.\nBut, nevertheless, it was not so; for he would retain both in\nhand; and did so as long as God's will was.  He was in his\nclerical state Bishop of Soissons; afterwards monk of Clugny; and\nthen prior in the same monastery.  Afterwards he became prior of\nSevigny; and then, because he was a relation of the King of\nEngland, and of the Earl of Poitou, the earl gave him the abbacy\nof St. John's minster of Angeli.  Afterwards, through his great\ncraft, he obtained the archbishopric of Besancon; and had it in\nhand three days; after which he justly lost it, because he had\nbefore unjustly obtained it.  Afterwards he procured the\nbishopric of Saintes; which was five miles from his abbey.  That\nhe had full-nigh a week (156) in hand; but the Abbot of Clugny\nbrought him thence, as he before did from Besancon.  Then he\nbethought him, that, if he could be fast-rooted in England, he\nmight have all his will.  Wherefore he besought the king, and\nsaid unto him, that he was an old man--a man completely broken--that\nhe could not brook the great injustice and the great\nhostility that were in their land: and then, by his own\nendearours, and by those of all his friends, he earnestly and\nexpressly entreated for the abbacy of Peterborough.  And the king\nprocured it for him, because he was his relation, and because he\nwas the principal person to make oath and bear witness when the\nson of the Earl of Normandy and the daughter of the Earl of Anjou\nwere divorced on the plea of consanguinity.  Thus wretchedly was\nthe abbacy given away, betwixt Christmas and Candlemas, at\nLondon; and so he went with the King to Winchester, and thence he\ncame to Peterborough, and there he dwelt (157) right so as a\ndrone doth in a hive.  For as the drone fretteth and draggeth\nfromward all that the bees drag toward [the hive], so did\nhe.--All that he might take, within and without, of learned and lewd,\nso sent he over sea; and no good did there--no good left there.\nThink no man unworthily that we say not the truth; for it was\nfully known over all the land: that, as soon as he came thither,\nwhich was on the Sunday when men sing \"Exurge quare o D---- etc.\"\nimmediately after, several persons saw and heard many huntsmen\nhunting.  The hunters were swarthy, and huge, and ugly; and their\nhounds were all swarthy, and broad-eyed, and ugly.  And they rode\non swarthy horses, and swarthy bucks.  This was seen in the very\ndeer-fold in the town of Peterborough, and in all the woods from\nthat same town to Stamford.  And the monks heard the horn blow\nthat they blew in the night.  Credible men, who watched them in\nthe night, said that they thought there might well be about\ntwenty or thirty horn-blowers.  This was seen and heard from the\ntime that he (158) came thither, all the Lent-tide onward to\nEaster.  This was his entry; of his exit we can as yet say\nnought.  God provide.", "A.D. 1128.  All this year was the King Henry in Normandy, on\naccount of the hostility that was between him and his nephew, the\nEarl of Flanders.  But the earl was wounded in a fight by a\nswain; and so wounded he went to the monastery of St. Bertin;\nwhere he soon became a monk, lived five days afterwards, then\ndied, and was there buried.  God honour his soul.  That was on\nthe sixth day before the calends of August.  This same year died\nthe Bishop Randulph Passeflambard of Durham; and was there buried\non the nones of September.  And this same year went the aforesaid\nAbbot Henry home to his own minster at Poitou by the king's\nleave.  He gave the king to understand, that he would withal\nforgo that minster, and that land, and dwell with him in England,\nand in the monastery of Peterborough.  But it was not so\nnevertheless.  He did this because he would be there, through his\ncrafty wiles, were it a twelvemonth or more, and come again\nafterwards.  May God Almighty extend his mercy over that wretched\nplace.  This same year came from Jerusalem Hugh of the Temple to\nthe king in Normandy; and the king received him with much honour,\nand gave him rich presents in gold and in silver.  And afterwards\nhe sent him into England; and there he was received by all good\nmen, who all gave him presents, and in Scotland also: and by him\nthey sent to Jerusalem much wealth withal in gold and in silver.\nAnd he invited folk out to Jerusalem; and there went with him and\nafter him more people than ever did before, since that the first\nexpedition was in the day of Pope Urban.  Though it availed\nlittle; for he said, that a mighty war was begun between the\nChristians and the heathens; but when they came thither, then was\nit nought but leasing. (159)  Thus pitifully was all that people\nswinked. (160)", "A.D. 1129.  In this year sent the King to England after the Earl\nWaleram, and after Hugh, the son of Gervase.  And they gave\nhostages for them.  And Hugh went home to his own land in France;\nbut Waleram was left with the king: and the king gave him all his\nland except his castle alone.  Afterwards came the king to\nEngland within the harvest: and the earl came with him: and they\nbecame as good friends as they were foes before.  Soon after, by\nthe king's counsel, and by his leave, sent the Archbishop William\nof Canterbury over all England, and bade bishops, and abbots, and\narchdeacons, and all the priors, monks, and canons, that were in\nall the cells in England, and all who had the care and\nsuperintendence of christianity, that they should all come to\nLondon at Michaelmas, and there should speak of all God's rights.\nWhen they came thither, then began the moot on Monday, and\ncontinued without intermission to the Friday.  When it all came\nforth, then was it all found to be about archdeacons' wives, and\nabout priests' wives; that they should forgo them by St. Andrew's\nmass; and he who would not do that, should forgo his church, and\nhis house, and his home, and never more have any calling thereto.\nThis bade the Archbishop William of Canterbury, and all the\ndiocesan bishops that were then in England, but the king gave\nthem all leave to go home.  And so they went home; and all the\nordinances amounted to nothing.  All held their wives by the\nking's leave as they did before.  This same year died the Bishop\nWilliam Giffard of Winchester; and was there buried, on the\neighth day before the calends of February.  And the King Henry\ngave the bishopric after Michaelmas to the Abbot Henry of\nGlastonbury, his nephew, and he was consecrated bishop by the\nArchbishop William of Canterbury on the fifteenth day before the\ncalends of December.  This same year died Pope Honorius.  Ere he\nwas well dead, there were chosen two popes.  The one was named\nPeter, who was monk of Clugny, and was born of the richest men of\nRome; and with him held those of Rome, and the Duke of Sicily.\nThe other was Gregory: he was a clerk, and was driven out of Rome\nby the other pope, and by his kinsmen.  With him held the Emperor\nof Saxony, and the King of France, and the King Henry of England,\nand all those on this side of the Alps.  Now was there such\ndivision in Christendom as never was before.  May Christ consult\nfor his wretched folk.  This same year, on the night of the mass\nof St. Nicholas, a little before day, there was a great\nearthquake.", "A.D. 1130.  This year was the monastery of Canterbury consecrated\nby the Archbishop William, on the fourth day before the nones of\nMay.  There were the Bishops John of Rochester, Gilbert Universal\nof London, Henry of Winchester, Alexander of Lincoln, Roger of\nSalisbury, Simon of Worcester, Roger of Coventry, Geoffry of\nBath, Evrard of Norwich, Sigefrith of Chichester, Bernard of St.\nDavid's, Owen of Evreux in Normandy, John of Sieyes.  On the\nfourth day after this was the King Henry in Rochester, when the\ntown was almost consumed by fire; and the Archbishop William\nconsecrated the monastery of St. Andrew, and the aforesaid\nbishops with him.  And the King Henry went over sea into Normandy\nin harvest.  This same year came the Abbot Henry of Angeli after\nEaster to Peterborough, and said that he had relinquished that\nmonastery (161) withal.  After him came the Abbot of Clugny,\nPeter by name, to England by the king's leave; and was received\nby all, whithersoever he came, with much respect.  To\nPeterborough he came; and there the Abbot Henry promised him that\nhe would procure him the minster of Peterborough, that it might\nbe subject to Clugny.  But it is said in the proverb,\n          \"The hedge abideth,\n          that acres divideth.\"\nMay God Almighty frustrate evil designs.  Soon after this, went\nthe Abbot of Clugny home to his country.  This year was Angus\nslain by the army of the Scots, and there was a great multitude\nslain with him.  There was God's fight sought upon him, for that\nhe was all forsworn.", "A.D. 1131.  This year, after Christmas, on a Monday night, at the\nfirst sleep, was the heaven on the northern hemisphere (162) all\nas if it were burning fire; so that all who saw it were so\ndismayed as they never were before.  That was on the third day\nbefore the ides of January.  This same year was so great a\nmurrain of cattle as never was before in the memory of man over\nall England.  That was in neat cattle and in swine; so that in a\ntown where there were ten ploughs going, or twelve, there was not\nleft one: and the man that had two hundred or three hundred\nswine, had not one left.  Afterwards perished the hen fowls; then\nshortened the fleshmeat, and the cheese, and the butter.  May God\nbetter it when it shall be his will.  And the King Henry came\nhome to England before harvest, after the mass of St. Peter \"ad\nvincula\".  This same year went the Abbot Henry, before Easter,\nfrom Peterborough over sea to Normandy, and there spoke with the\nking, and told him that the Abbot of Clugny had desired him to\ncome to him, and resign to him the abbacy of Angeli, after which\nhe would go home by his leave.  And so he went home to his own\nminster, and there remained even to midsummer day.  And the next\nday after the festival of St. John chose the monks an abbot of\nthemselves, brought him into the church in procession, sang \"Te\nDeum laudamus\", rang the bells, set him on the abbot's throne,\ndid him all homage, as they should do their abbot: and the earl,\nand all the head men, and the monks of the minster, drove the\nother Abbot Henry out of the monastery.  And they had need; for\nin five-and-twenty winters had they never hailed one good day.\nHere failed him all his mighty crafts.  Now it behoved him, that\nhe crope in his skin into every corner, if peradventure there\nwere any unresty wrench, (163) whereby he might yet once more\nbetray Christ and all Christian people.  Then retired he into\nClugny, where he was held so fast, that he could not move east or\nwest.  The Abbot of Clugny said that they had lost St. John's\nminster through him, and through his great sottishness.  Then\ncould he not better recompense them; but he promised them, and\nswore oaths on the holy cross, that if he might go to England he\nshould get them the minster of Peterborough; so that he should\nset there the prior of Clugny, with a churchwarden, a treasurer,\nand a sacristan: and all the things that were within the minster\nand without, he should procure for them.  Thus he departed into\nFrance; and there remained all that year.  Christ provide for the\nwretched monks of Peterborough, and for that wretched place.  Now\ndo they need the help of Christ and of all Christian folk.", "A.D. 1132.  This year came King Henry to this land.  Then came\nAbbot Henry, and betrayed the monks of Peterborough to the king,\nbecause he would subject that minster to Clugny; so that the king\nwas well nigh entrapped, and sent after the monks.  But through\nthe grace of God, and through the Bishop of Salisbury, and the\nBishop of Lincoln, and the other rich men that were there, the\nking knew that he proceeded with treachery.  When he no more\ncould do, then would he that his nephew should be Abbot of\nPeterborough.  But Christ forbade.  Not very long after this was\nit that the king sent after him, and made him give up the Abbey\nof Peterborough, and go out of the land.  And the king gave the\nabbacy to a prior of St. Neot's, called Martin, who came on St.\nPeter's mass-day with great pomp into the minster.", "A.D. 1135.  In this year went the King Henry over sea at the\nLammas; and the next day, as he lay asleep on ship, the day\ndarkened over all lands, and the sun was all as it were a three\nnight old moon, and the stars about him at midday.  Men were very\nmuch astonished and terrified, and said that a great event should\ncome hereafter.  So it did; for that same year was the king dead,\nthe next day after St. Andrew's mass-day, in Normandy.  Then was\nthere soon tribulation in the land; for every man that might,\nsoon robbed another.  Then his sons and his friends took his\nbody, and brought it to England, and buried it at Reading.  A\ngood man he was; and there was great dread of him.  No man durst\ndo wrong with another in his time.  Peace he made for man and\nbeast.  Whoso bare his burthen of gold and silver, durst no man\nsay ought to him but good.  Meanwhile was his nephew come to\nEngland, Stephen de Blois.  He came to London, and the people of\nLondon received him, and sent after the Archbishop William\nCurboil, and hallowed him to king on midwinter day.  In this\nking's time was all dissention, and evil, and rapine; for against\nhim rose soon the rich men who were traitors; and first of all\nBaldwin de Redvers, who held Exeter against him.  But the king\nbeset it; and afterwards Baldwin accorded.  Then took the others,\nand held their castles against him; and David, King of Scotland,\ntook to Wessington against him.  Nevertheless their messengers\npassed between them; and they came together, and were settled,\nbut it availed little.", "A.D. 1137.  This year went the King Stephen over sea to Normandy,\nand there was received; for that they concluded that he should be\nall such as the uncle was; and because he had got his treasure:\nbut he dealed it out, and scattered it foolishly.  Much had King\nHenry gathered, gold and silver, but no good did men for his soul\nthereof.  When the King Stephen came to England, he held his\ncouncil at Oxford; where he seized the Bishop Roger of Sarum, and\nAlexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and the chancellor Roger, his\nnephew; and threw all into prison till they gave up their\ncastles.  When the traitors understood that he was a mild man,\nand soft, and good, and no justice executed, then did they all\nwonder.  They had done him homage, and sworn oaths, but they no\ntruth maintained.  They were all forsworn, and forgetful of their\ntroth; for every rich man built his castles, which they held\nagainst him: and they filled the land full of castles.  They\ncruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle-works;\nand when the castles were made, they filled them with devils and\nevil men.  Then took they those whom they supposed to have any\ngoods, both by night and by day, labouring men and women, and\nthrew them into prison for their gold and silver, and inflicted\non them unutterable tortures; for never were any martyrs so\ntortured as they were.  Some they hanged up by the feet, and\nsmoked them with foul smoke; and some by the thumbs, or by the\nhead, and hung coats of mail on their feet.  They tied knotted\nstrings about their heads, and twisted them till the pain went to\nthe brains.  They put them into dungeons, wherein were adders,\nand snakes, and toads; and so destroyed them.  Some they placed\nin a crucet-house; that is, in a chest that was short and narrow,\nand not deep; wherein they put sharp stones, and so thrust the\nman therein, that they broke all the limbs.  In many of the\ncastles were things loathsome and grim, called \"Sachenteges\", of\nwhich two or three men had enough to bear one.  It was thus made:\nthat is, fastened to a beam; and they placed a sharp iron\n[collar] about the man's throat and neck, so that he could in no\ndirection either sit, or lie, or sleep, but bear all that iron.\nMany thousands they wore out with hunger.  I neither can, nor may\nI tell all the wounds and all the pains which they inflicted on\nwretched men in this land.  This lasted the nineteen winters\nwhile Stephen was king; and it grew continually worse and worse.\nThey constantly laid guilds on the towns, and called it\n\"tenserie\"; and when the wretched men had no more to give, then\nthey plundered and burned all the towns; that well thou mightest\ngo a whole day's journey and never shouldest thou find a man\nsitting in a town, nor the land tilled.  Then was corn dear, and\nflesh, and cheese, and butter; for none was there in the land.\nWretched men starved of hunger.  Some had recourse to alms, who\nwere for a while rich men, and some fled out of the land.  Never\nyet was there more wretchedness in the land; nor ever did heathen\nmen worse than they did: for, after a time, they spared neither\nchurch nor churchyard, but took all the goods that were therein,\nand then burned the church and all together.  Neither did they\nspare a bishop's land, or an abbot's, or a priest's, but\nplundered both monks and clerks; and every man robbed another who\ncould.  If two men, or three, came riding to a town, all the\ntownship fled for them, concluding them to be robbers.  The\nbishops and learned men cursed them continually, but the effect\nthereof was nothing to them; for they were all accursed, and\nforsworn, and abandoned.  To till the ground was to plough the\nsea: the earth bare no corn, for the land was all laid waste by\nsuch deeds; and they said openly, that Christ slept, and his\nsaints.  Such things, and more than we can say, suffered we\nnineteen winters for our sins.  In all this evil time held Abbot\nMartin his abbacy twenty years and a half, and eight days, with\nmuch tribulation; and found the monks and the guests everything\nthat behoved them; and held much charity in the house; and,\nnotwithstanding all this, wrought on the church, and set thereto\nlands and rents, and enriched it very much, and bestowed\nvestments upon it.  And he brought them into the new minster on\nSt. Peter's mass-day with much pomp; which was in the year, from\nthe incarnation of our Lord, 1140, and in the twenty-third from\nthe destruction of the place by fire.  And he went to Rome, and\nthere was well received by the Pope Eugenius; from whom he\nobtained their privileges:--one for all the lands of the abbey,\nand another for the lands that adjoin to the churchyard; and, if\nhe might have lived longer, so he meant to do concerning the\ntreasury.  And he got in the lands that rich men retained by main\nstrength.  Of William Malduit, who held the castle of Rockingham,\nhe won Cotingham and Easton; and of Hugh de Walteville, he won\nHirtlingbury and Stanwick, and sixty shillings from Oldwinkle\neach year.  And he made many monks, and planted a vine-yard, and\nconstructed many works, and made the town better than it was\nbefore.  He was a good monk, and a good man; and for this reason\nGod and good men loved him.  Now we will relate in part what\nhappened in King Stephen's time.  In his reign the Jews of\nNorwich bought a Christian child before Easter, and tortured him\nafter the same manner as our Lord was tortured; and on Long-Friday\n(164) hanged him on a rood, in mockery of our Lord, and\nafterwards buried him.  They supposed that it would be concealed,\nbut our Lord showed that he was a holy martyr.  And the monks\ntook him, and buried him with high honour in the minster.  And\nthrough our Lord he worketh wonderful and manifold miracles, and\nis called St. William.", "A.D. 1138.  In this year came David, King of Scotland, with an\nimmense army to this land.  He was ambitious to win this land;\nbut against him came William, Earl of Albemarle, to whom the king\nhad committed York, and other borderers, with few men, and fought\nagainst them, and routed the king at the Standard, and slew very\nmany of his gang.", "A.D. 1140.  In this year wished the King Stephen to take Robert,\nEarl of Gloucester, the son of King Henry; but he could not, for\nhe was aware of it.  After this, in the Lent, the sun and the day\ndarkened about the noon-tide of the day, when men were eating;\nand they lighted candles to eat by.  That was the thirteenth day\nbefore the kalends of April.  Men were very much struck with\nwonder.  Thereafter died William, Archbishop of Canterbury; and\nthe king made Theobald archbishop, who was Abbot of Bec.  After\nthis waxed a very great war betwixt the king and Randolph, Earl\nof Chester; not because he did not give him all that he could ask\nhim, as he did to all others; but ever the more he gave them, the\nworse they were to him.  The Earl held Lincoln against the king,\nand took away from him all that he ought to have.  And the king\nwent thither, and beset him and his brother William de Romare in\nthe castle.  And the earl stole out, and went after Robert, Earl\nof Glocester, and brought him thither with a large army.  And\nthey fought strenuously on Candlemas day against their lord, and\ntook him; for his men forsook him and fled.  And they led him to\nBristol, and there put him into prison in close quarters.  Then\nwas all England stirred more than ere was, and all evil was in\nthe land.  Afterwards came the daughter of King Henry, who had\nbeen Empress of Germany, and now was Countess of Anjou.  She came\nto London; but the people of London attempted to take her, and\nshe fled, losing many of her followers.  After this the Bishop of\nWinchester, Henry, the brother of King Stephen, spake with Earl\nRobert, and with the empress, and swore them oaths, \"that he\nnever more would hold with the king, his brother,\" and cursed all\nthe men that held with him, and told them, that he would give\nthem up Winchester; and he caused them to come thither.  When\nthey were therein, then came the king's queen with all her\nstrength, and beset them, so that there was great hunger therein.\nWhen they could no longer hold out, then stole they out, and\nfled; but those without were aware, and followed them, and took\nRobert, Earl of Glocester, and led him to Rochester, and put him\nthere into prison; but the empress fled into a monastery.  Then\nwent the wise men between the king's friends and the earl's\nfriends; and settled so that they should let the king out of\nprison for the earl, and the earl for the king; and so they did.\nAfter this settled the king and Earl Randolph at Stamford, and\nswore oaths, and plighted their troth, that neither should betray\nthe other.  But it availed nothing.  For the king afterwards took\nhim at Northampton, through wicked counsel, and put him into\nprison; and soon after he let him out again, through worse\ncounsel, on the condition that he swore by the crucifix, and\nfound hostages, that he would give up all his castles.  Some he\ngave up, and some gave he not up; and did then worse than he\notherwise would.  Then was England very much divided.  Some held\nwith the king, and some with the empress; for when the king was\nin prison, the earls and the rich men supposed that he never more\nwould come out: and they settled with the empress, and brought\nher into Oxford, and gave her the borough.  When the king was\nout, he heard of this, and took his force, and beset her in the\ntower. (165)  And they let her down in the night from the tower\nby ropes.  And she stole out, and fled, and went on foot to\nWallingford.  Afterwards she went over sea; and those of Normandy\nturned all from the king to the Earl of Anjou; some willingly,\nand some against their will; for he beset them till they gave up\ntheir castles, and they had no help of the king.  Then went\nEustace, the king's son, to France, and took to wife the sister\nof the King of France.  He thought to obtain Normandy thereby;\nbut he sped little, and by good right; for he was an evil man.\nWherever he was, he did more evil than good; he robbed the lands,\nand levied heavy guilds upon them.  He brought his wife to\nEngland, and put her into the castle at...  (166)  Good woman she\nwas; but she had little bliss with him; and Christ would not that\nhe should long reign.  He therefore soon died, and his mother\nalso.  And the Earl of Anjou died; and his son Henry took to the\nearldom.  And the Queen of France parted from the king; and she\ncame to the young Earl Henry; and he took her to wife, and all\nPoitou with her.  Then went he with a large force into England,\nand won some castles; and the king went against him with a much\nlarger force.  Nevertheless, fought they not; but the archbishop\nand the wise men went between them, and made this settlement:\nThat the king should be lord and king while he lived, and after\nhis day Henry should be king: that Henry should take him for a\nfather; and he him for a son: that peace and union should be\nbetwixt them, and in all England.  This and the other provisions\nthat they made, swore the king and the earl to observe; and all\nthe bishops, and the earls, and the rich men.  Then was the earl\nreceived at Winchester, and at London, with great worship; and\nall did him homage, and swore to keep the peace.  And there was\nsoon so good a peace as never was there before.  Then was the\nking stronger than he ever was before.  And the earl went over\nsea; and all people loved him; for he did good justice, and made\npeace.", "A.D. 1154.  In this year died the King Stephen; and he was buried\nwhere his wife and his son were buried, at Faversham; which\nmonastery they founded.  When the king died, then was the earl\nbeyond sea; but no man durst do other than good for the great\nfear of him.  When he came to England, then was he received with\ngreat worship, and blessed to king in London on the Sunday before\nmidwinter day.  And there held he a full court.  The same day\nthat Martin, Abbot of Peterborough, should have gone thither,\nthen sickened he, and died on the fourth day before the nones of\nJanuary; and the monks, within the day, chose another of\nthemselves, whose name was William de Walteville, (167) a good\nclerk, and good man, and well beloved of the king, and of all\ngood men.  And all the monks buried the abbot with high honours.\nAnd soon the newly chosen abbot, and the monks with him, went to\nOxford to the king.  And the king gave him the abbacy; and he\nproceeded soon afterwards to Peterborough; where he remained with\nthe abbot, ere he came home.  And the king was received with\ngreat worship at Peterborough, in full procession.  And so he was\nalso at Ramsey, and at Thorney, and at.... and at Spalding, and\nat...."]

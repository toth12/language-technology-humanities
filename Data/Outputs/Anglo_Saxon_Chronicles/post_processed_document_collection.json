This year died Ethelbert, king of Kent, the first of<br> English kings that received baptism: he was the son of Ermenric.<br> He reigned fifty-six winters, and was succeeded by his son<br> Eadbald. And in this same year had elapsed from the beginning of<br> the world five thousand six hundred and eighteen winters. This<br> Eadbald renounced his baptism, and lived in a heathen manner; so<br> that he took to wife the relict of his father. Then Laurentius,<br> who was archbishop in Kent, meant to depart southward over sea,<br> and abandon everything. But there came to him in the night the<br> apostle Peter, and severely chastised him, (19) because he would<br> so desert the flock of God. And he charged him to go to the<br> king, and teach him the right belief. And he did so; and the<br> king returned to the right belief. In this king's days the same<br> Laurentius, who was archbishop in Kent after Augustine, departed<br> this life on the second of February, and was buried near<br> Augustine.

The<br> king loved it much, for the love of his brother Peada, and for<br> the love of his wed-brother Oswy, and for the love of Saxulf the<br> abbot. He said, therefore, that he would dignify and honour it<br> by the counsel of his brothers, Ethelred and Merwal; and by the<br> counsel of his sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha; and by the<br> counsel of the archbishop, who was called Deus-dedit; and by the<br> counsel of all his peers, learned and lewd, that in his kingdom<br> were. And he so did. Then sent the king after the abbot, that<br> he should immediately come to him. And he so did. Then said the<br> king to the abbot: \"Beloved Saxulf, I have sent after thee for<br> the good of my soul; and I will plainly tell thee for why. My<br> brother Peada and my beloved friend Oswy began a minster, for the<br> love of Christ and St. Peter: but my brother, as Christ willed,<br> is departed from this life; I will therefore intreat thee,<br> beloved friend, that they earnestly proceed on their work; and I<br> will find thee thereto gold and silver, land and possessions, and<br> all that thereto behoveth.\" Then went the abbot home, and began<br> to work. So he sped, as Christ permitted him; so that in a few<br> years was that minster ready. Then, when the king heard say<br> that, he was very glad; and bade men send through all the nation,<br> after all his thanes; after the archbishop, and after bishops:<br> and after his earls; and after all those that loved God; that<br> they should come to him. And he fixed the day when men should<br> hallow the minster. And when they were hallowing the minster,<br> there was the king, Wulfere, and his brother Ethelred, and his<br> sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha. And the minster was hallowed<br> by Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury; and the Bishop of<br> Rochester, Ithamar; and the Bishop of London, who was called<br> Wina; and the Bishop of the Mercians, whose name was Jeruman; and<br> Bishop Tuda. And there was Wilfrid, priest, that after was<br> bishop; and there were all his thanes that were in his kingdom.<br> When the minster was hallowed, in the name of St. Peter, and St.<br> Paul, and St. Andrew, then stood up the king before all his<br> thanes, and said with a loud voice: \"Thanks be to the high<br> almighty God for this worship that here is done; and I will this<br> day glorify Christ and St. Peter, and I will that you all confirm<br> my words.--I Wulfere give to-day to St. Peter, and the Abbot<br> Saxulf, and the monks of the minster, these lands, and these<br> waters, and meres, and fens, and weirs, and all the lands that<br> thereabout lye, that are of my kingdom, freely, so that no man<br> have there any ingress, but the abbot and the monks. This is the<br> gift.

Thus I will free this minster; that it be not subject<br> except to Rome alone; and hither I will that we seek St. Peter,<br> all that to Rome cannot go.\" During these words the abbot<br> desired that he would gant him his request. And the king granted<br> it. \"I have here (said he) some good monks that would lead their<br> life in retirement, if they wist where. Now here is an island,<br> that is called Ankerig; and I will request, that we may there<br> build a minster to the honour of St. Mary; that they may dwell<br> there who will lead their lives in peace and tranquillity.\" Then<br> answered the king, and quoth thus: \"Beloved Saxulf, not that only<br> which thou desirest, but all things that I know thou desirest in<br> our Lord's behalf, so I approve, and grant. And I bid thee,<br> brother Ethelred, and my sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, for<br> the release of your souls, that you be witnesses, and that you<br> subscribe it with your fingers. And I pray all that come after<br> me, be they my sons, be they my brethren, or kings that come<br> after me, that our gift may stand; as they would be partakers of<br> the life everlasting, and as they would avoid everlasting<br> punishment. Whoso lesseneth our gift, or the gift of other good<br> men, may the heavenly porter lessen him in the kingdom of heaven;<br> and whoso advanceth it, may the heavenly porter advance him in<br> the kingdom of heaven.\" These are the witnesses that were there,<br> and that subscribed it with their fingers on the cross of Christ,<br> and confirmed it with their tongues. That was, first the king,<br> Wulfere, who confirmed it first with his word, and afterwards<br> wrote with his finger on the cross of Christ, saying thus: \"I<br> Wulfere, king, in the presence of kings, and of earls, and of<br> captains, and of thanes, the witnesses of my gift, before the<br> Archbishop Deus-dedit, I confirm it with the cross of Christ.\"<br> (+)--\"And I Oswy, king of the Northumbrians, the friend of this<br> minster, and o[oe] the Abbot Saxulf, commend it with the cross of<br> Christ.\" (+)--\"And I Sighere, king, ratify it with the cross of<br> Christ.\" (+)--\"And I Sibbi, king, subscribe it with the cross<br> of Christ.\" (+)--\"And I Ethelred, the king's brother, granted<br> the same with the cross of Christ.\" (+)--\"And we, the king's<br> sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, approve it.\"--\"And I<br> Archbishop of Canterbury, Deus-dedit, ratify it.\"--Then<br> confirmed it all the others that were there with the cross of<br> Christ (+): namely, Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester; Wina, Bishop of<br> London; Jeruman, Bishop of the Mercians; and Tuda, bishop; and<br> Wilfrid, priest, who was afterwards bishop; and Eoppa, priest,<br> whom the king, Wulfere, sent to preach christianity in the Isle<br> of Wight; and Saxulf, abbot; and Immine, alderman, and Edbert,<br> alderman, and Herefrith, alderman, and Wilbert, alderman, and<br> Abo, alderman; Ethelbald, Brord, Wilbert, Elmund, Frethegis.<br> These, and many others that were there, the king's most loyal<br> subjects, confirmed it all. This charter was written after our<br> Lord's Nativity 664--the seventh year of King Wulfere--the<br> ninth year of Archbishop Deus-dedir. Then they laid God's curse,<br> and the curse of all saints, and all christian folks, on<br> whosoever undid anything that there was done. \"So be it,\" saith<br> all. \"Amen.\"--When this thing was done, then sent the king to<br> Rome to the Pope Vitalianus that then was, and desired, that he<br> would ratify with his writ and with his blessing, all this<br> aforesaid thing. And the pope then sent his writ, thus saying:<br> \"I Vitalianus, pope, grant thee, King Wulfere, and Deus-dedit,<br> archbishop, and Abbot Saxulf, all the things that you desire.<br> And I forbid, that any king, or any man, have any ingress, but<br> the abbot alone; nor shall he be Subject to any man, except the<br> Pope of Rome and the Archbishop of Canterbury. If any one<br> breaketh anything of this, St. Peter with his sword destroy him.<br> Whosoever holdeth it, St. Peter with heaven's key undo him the<br> kingdom of heaven.\"--Thus was the minster of Medhamsted begun,<br> that was afterwards called Peter-borough. Afterwards came<br> another archbishop to Canterbury, who was called Theodorus; a<br> very good man and wise; and held his synod with his bishops and<br> with his clerk.

In his time sent he to<br> Rome Bishop Wilfrid to the pope that then was, called Agatho, and<br> told him by word and by letter, how his brothers Peada and<br> Wulfere, and the Abbot Saxulf, had wrought a minster, called<br> Medhamsted; and that they had freed it, against king and against<br> bishop, from every service; and he besought him that he would<br> confirm it with his writ and with his blessing. And the pope<br> sent then his writ to England, thus saying: \"I Agatho, Pope of<br> Rome, greet well the worthy Ethelred, king of the Mercians, and<br> the Archbishop Theodorus of Canterbury, and Saxulf, the bishop of<br> the Mercians, who before was abbot, and all the abbots that are<br> in England; God's greeting and my blessing. I have heard the<br> petition of King Ethelred, and of the Archbishop Theodorus, and<br> of the Bishop Saxulf, and of the Abbot Cuthbald; and I will it,<br> that it in all wise be as you have spoken it. And I ordain, in<br> behalf of God, and of St. Peter, and of all saints, and of every<br> hooded head, that neither king, nor bishop, nor earl, nor any man<br> whatever, have any claim, or gable, or gild, or levy, or take any<br> service of any kind, from the abbey of Medhamsted. I command<br> also, that no shire-bishop be so bold as to hold an ordination or<br> consecration within this abbacy, except the abbot intreat him,<br> nor have there any claim to proxies, or synodals, or anything<br> whatever of any kind. And I will, that the abbot be holden for<br> legate of Rome over all that island; and whatever abbot is there<br> chosen by the monks that he be consecrated by the Archbishop of<br> Canterbury. I will and decree, that, whatever man may have made<br> a vow to go to Rome, and cannot perform it, either from<br> infirmity, or for his lord's need, or from poverty, or from any<br> other necessity of any kind whatever, whereby he cannot come<br> thither, be he of England, or of whatever other island he be, he<br> may come to that minster of Medhamsted, and have the same<br> forgiveness of Christ and St. Peter, and of the abbot, and of the<br> monks, that he should have if he went to Rome. Now bid I thee,<br> brother Theodorus, that thou let it be proclaimed through all<br> England, that a synod be gathered, and this writ be read and<br> observed. Also I tell thee, Bishop Saxulf, that, as thou<br> desirest it, that the minster be free, so I forbid thee, and all<br> the bishops that after thee come, from Christ and from all his<br> saints, that ye have no demand from that minster, except so much<br> as the abbot will. Now will I say in a word, that, whoso holdeth<br> this writ and this decree, then be he ever dwelling with God<br> Almighty in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso breaketh it, then<br> be he excommunicated, and thrust down with Judas, and with all<br> the devils in hell, except he come to repentance. Amen!\" This<br> writ sent the Pope Agatho, and a hundred and twenty-five bishops,<br> by Wilfrid, Archbishop of York, to England. This was done after<br> our Lord's Nativity 680, the sixth year of King Ethelred. Then<br> the king commanded the Archbishop Theodorus, that he should<br> appoint a general Wittenmoot at the place called Hatfield. When<br> they were there collected, then he allowed the letter to be read<br> that the pope sent thither; and all ratified and confirmed it.<br> Then said the king: \"All things that my brother Peada, and my<br> brother Wulfere, and my sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, gave<br> and granted to St. Peter and the abbot, these I will may stand;<br> and I will in my day increase it, for their souls and for my<br> soul.

But he having understood that<br> the king was gone, thinly attended, on a visit to a lady at<br> Merton, (28) rode after him, and beset him therein; surrounding<br> the town without, ere the attendants of the king were aware of<br> him. When the king found this, he went out of doors, and<br> defended himself with courage; till, having looked on the<br> etheling, he rushed out upon him, and wounded him severely. Then<br> were they all fighting against the king, until they had slain<br> him. As soon as the king's thanes in the lady's bower heard the<br> tumult, they ran to the spot, whoever was then ready. The<br> etheling immediately offered them life and rewards; which none of<br> them would accept, but continued fighting together against him,<br> till they all lay dead, except one British hostage, and he was<br> severely wounded. When the king's thanes that were behind heard<br> in the morning that the king was slain, they rode to the spot,<br> Osric his alderman, and Wiverth his thane, and the men that he<br> had left behind; and they met the etheling at the town, where the<br> king lay slain. The gates, however, were locked against them,<br> which they attempted to force; but he promised them their own<br> choice of money and land, if they would grant him the kingdom;<br> reminding them, that their relatives were already with him, who<br> would never desert him. To which they answered, that no relative<br> could be dearer to them than their lord, and that they would<br> never follow his murderer. Then they besought their relatives to<br> depart from him, safe and sound. They replied, that the same<br> request was made to their comrades that were formerly with the<br> king; \"And we are as regardless of the result,\" they rejoined,<br> \"as our comrades who with the king were slain.\" Then they<br> continued fighting at the gates, till they rushed in, and slew<br> the etheling and all the men that were with him; except one, who<br> was the godson of the alderman, and whose life he spared, though<br> he was often wounded. This same Cynewulf reigned one and thirty<br> winters. His body lies at Winchester, and that of the etheling<br> at Axminster. Their paternal pedigree goeth in a direct line to<br> Cerdic. The same year Ethelbald, king of the Mercians, was slain<br> at Seckington; and his body lies at Repton.

He<br> was the son of that Charles whose daughter Ethelwulf, king of the<br> West-Saxons, had to wife. And the same year collected a great<br> fleet against Old-Saxony; and there was a great fight twice in<br> the year, and the Saxons had the victory. There were the<br> Frieslanders with them. And the same year succeeded Charles to<br> the Western kingdom, and to all the territory this side of the<br> Mediterranean and beyond, as his great-grandfather held it,<br> except the Lidwiccians. The said Charles was the son of Louis,<br> who was the brother of that Charles who was the father of Judith,<br> whom Ethelwulf, king of the West-Saxons, married. They were the<br> sons of Louis, who was the son of the elder Charles, who was the<br> son of Pepin. The same year died the good Pope Martin, who freed<br> the English school at the request of Alfred, king of the<br> West-Saxons. And he sent him great gifts in relics, and a part<br> of the rood on which Christ suffered.

This<br> same year died Charles, king of the Franks. Arnulf, his<br> brother's son, had six weeks before his death bereft him of his<br> kingdom; which was now divided into five portions, and five kings<br> were consecrated thereto. This, however, was done with the<br> consent of Arnulf; and they agreed that they should hold in<br> subjection to him; because none of them had by birth any claim on<br> the father's side, except him alone. Arnulf, therefore, dwelt in<br> the country eastward of the Rhine; Rodulf took to the middle<br> district; Oda to the western; whilst Berenger and Witha became<br> masters of Lombardy and the Cisalpine territory. But they held<br> their dominion in great discord; fought two general battles, and<br> frequently overran the country in partial encounters, displacing<br> each other several times.

This year went the army eastward; and King Arnulf<br> fought with the land-force, ere the ships arrived, in conjunction<br> with the eastern Franks, and Saxons, and Bavarians, and put them<br> to flight. And three Scots came to King Alfred in a boat without<br> any oars from Ireland; whence they stole away, because they would<br> live in a state of pilgrimage, for the love of God, they recked<br> not where. The boat in which they came was made of two hides and<br> a half; and they took with them provisions for seven nights; and<br> within seven nights they came to land in Cornwall, and soon after<br> went to King Alfred. They were thus named: Dubslane, and<br> Macbeth, and Maelinmun. And Swinney, the best teacher that was<br> among the Scots, departed this life. And the same year after<br> Easter, about the gang-days or before, appeared the star that men<br> in book-Latin call \"cometa\": some men say that in English it may<br> be termed \"hairy star\"; for that there standeth off from it a<br> long gleam of light, whilom on one side, whilom on each.<br>army<br>call<br>depart_life<br>ere<br>fight<br>hide<br>king<br>land<br>land_force<br>love<br>provision<br>put_flight<br>scot<br>ship<br>star<br>steal", "A.D. 893. This year went the large army, that we before spoke<br> about, back from the eastern district westward to Bologne; and<br> there were shipped; so that they transported themselves over at<br> one time with their horses withal. And they came up with two<br> hundred and fifty ships into the mouth of the Limne, which is in<br> East-Kent, at the east end of the vast wood that we call Andred.<br> This wood is in length, east and west, one hundred and twenty<br> miles, or longer, and thirty miles broad. The river that we<br> before spoke about lieth out of the weald. On this river they<br> towed up their ships as far as the weald, four miles from the<br> mouth outwards; and there destroyed a fort within the fen,<br> whereon sat a few churls, and which was hastily wrought.

This year, that was about twelve months after they had<br> wrought a work in the eastern district, the Northumbrians and<br> East-Angles had given oaths to King Alfred, and the East-Angles<br> six hostages; nevertheless, contrary to the truce, as oft as the<br> other plunderers went out with all their army, then went they<br> also, either with them, or in a separate division. Upon this<br> King Alfred gathered his army, and advanced, so that he encamped<br> between the two armies at the highest point he could find<br> defended by wood and by water, that he might reach either, if<br> they would seek any field. Then went they forth in quest of the<br> wealds, in troops and companies, wheresoever the country was<br> defenceless. But they were also sought after most days by other<br> companies, either by day or by night, both from the army and also<br> from the towns. The king had divided his army into two parts; so<br> that they were always half at home, half out; besides the men<br> that should maintain the towns. The army came not all out of<br> their stations more than twice; once, when they first came to<br> land, ere the forces were collected, and again, when they wished<br> to depart from their stations. They had now seized much booty,<br> and would ferry it northward over Thames into Essex, to meet<br> their ships. But the army rode before them, fought with them at<br> Farnham, routed their forces, and there arrested the booty. And<br> they flew over Thames without any ford, then up by the Colne on<br> an island. Then the king's forces beset them without as long as<br> they had food; but they had their time set, and their meat noted.<br> And the king was advancing thitherwards on his march with the<br> division that accompanied him. But while he was advancing<br> thitherwards, the other force was returning homewards. The<br> Danes, however, still remained behind; for their king was wounded<br> in the fight, so that they could not carry him. Then collected<br> together those that dwell in Northumbria and East-Anglia about a<br> hundred ships, and went south about; and with some forty more<br> went north about, and besieged a fort in Devonshire by the north<br> sea; and those who went south about beset Exeter. When the king<br> heard that, then went he west towards Exeter with all his force,<br> except a very considerable part of the eastern army, who advanced<br> till they came to London; and there being joined by the citizens<br> and the reinforcements that came from the west, they went east to<br> Barnfleet. Hasten was there with his gang, who before were<br> stationed at Milton, and also the main army had come thither,<br> that sat before in the mouth of the Limne at Appledore. Hasten<br> had formerly constructed that work at Barnfleet, and was then<br> gone out on plunder, the main army being at home. Then came the<br> king's troops, and routed the enemy, broke down the work, took<br> all that was therein money, women, and children and brought all<br> to London. And all the ships they either broke to pieces, or<br> burned, or brought to London or to Rochester. And Hasten's wife<br> and her two sons they brought to the king, who returned them to<br> him, because one of them was his godson, and the other Alderman<br> Ethered's. They had adopted them ere Hasten came to Bamfleet;<br> when he had given them hostages and oaths, and the king had also<br> given him many presents; as he did also then, when he returned<br> the child and the wife. And as soon as they came to Bamfleet,<br> and the work was built, then plundered he in the same quarter of<br> his kingdom that Ethered his compeer should have held; and at<br> another time he was plundering in the same district when his work<br> was destroyed. The king then went westward with the army toward<br> Exeter, as I before said, and the army had beset the city; but<br> whilst he was gone they went to their ships. Whilst he was thus<br> busied there with the army, in the west, the marauding parties<br> were both gathered together at Shobury in Essex, and there built<br> a fortress. Then they both went together up by the Thames, and a<br> great concourse joined them, both from the East-Angles and from<br> the Northumbrians. They then advanced upward by the Thames, till<br> they arrived near the Severn. Then they proceeded upward by the<br> Severn. Meanwhile assembled Alderman Ethered, Alderman Ethelm,<br> Alderman Ethelnoth, and the king's thanes, who were employed at<br> home at the works, from every town east of the Parret, as well as<br> west of Selwood, and from the parts east and also north of the<br> Thames and west of the Severn, and also some part of North-Wales.<br> When they were all collected together, they overtook the rear of<br> the enemy at Buttington on the banks of the Severn, and there<br> beset them without on each side in a fortress. When they had sat<br> there many weeks on both sides of the water, and the king<br> meanwhile was in Devonshire westward with the naval force, then<br> were the enemy weighed down with famine. They had devoured the<br> greater part of their horses; and the rest had perished with<br> hunger. Then went they out to the men that sat on the eastern<br> side of the river, and fought with them; but the Christians had<br> the victory. And there Ordhelm, the king's thane, was slain; and<br> also many other king's thanes; and of the Danes there were many<br> slain, and that part of them that came away escaped only by<br> flight. As soon as they came into Essex to their fortress, and<br> to their ships, then gathered the remnant again in East-Anglia<br> and from the Northumbrians a great force before winter, and<br> having committed their wives and their ships and their booty to<br> the East-Angles, they marched on the stretch by day and night,<br> till they arrived at a western city in Wirheal that is called<br> Chester. There the army could not overtake them ere they arrived<br> within the work: they beset the work though, without, some two<br> days, took all the cattle that was thereabout, slew the men whom<br> they could overtake without the work, and all the corn they<br> either burned or consumed with their horses every evening.

Soon after that, in this year, went the army from<br> Wirheal into North-Wales; for they could not remain there,<br> because they were stripped both of the cattle and the corn that<br> they had acquired by plunder. When they went again out of<br> North-Wales with the booty they had acquired there, they marched over<br> Northumberland and East-Anglia, so that the king's army could not<br> reach them till they came into Essex eastward, on an island that<br> is out at sea, called Mersey. And as the army returned homeward<br> that had beset Exeter, they went up plundering in Sussex nigh<br> Chichester; but the townsmen put them to flight, and slew many<br> hundreds of them, and took some of their ships. Then, in the<br> same year, before winter, the Danes, who abode in Mersey, towed<br> their ships up on the Thames, and thence up the Lea.

This same year wrought the aforesaid army a work by<br> the Lea, twenty miles above the city of London. Then, in the<br> summer of this year, went a large party of the citizens, and also<br> of other folk, and made an attack on the work of the Danes; but<br> they were there routed, and some four of the king's thanes were<br> slain. In the harvest afterward the king encamped close to the<br> city, whilst they reaped their corn, that the Danes might not<br> deprive them of the crop. Then, some day, rode the king up by<br> the river; and observed a place where the river might be<br> obstructed, so that they could not bring out their ships. And<br> they did so. They wrought two works on the two sides of the<br> river. And when they had begun the work, and encamped before it,<br> then understood the army that they could not bring out their<br> ships. Whereupon they left them, and went over land, till they<br> came to Quatbridge by Severn; and there wrought a work. Then<br> rode the king's army westward after the enemy. And the men of<br> London fetched the ships; and all that they could not lead away<br> they broke up; but all that were worthy of capture they brought<br> into the port of London. And the Danes procured an asylum for<br> their wives among the East-Angles, ere they went out of the fort.<br> During the winter they abode at Quatbridge.

In the summer of this year went the army, some into<br> East-Anglia, and some into Northumbria; and those that were<br> penniless got themselves ships, and went south over sea to the<br> Seine. The enemy had not, thank God, entirely destroyed the<br> English nation; but they were much more weakened in these three<br> years by the disease of cattle, and most of all of men; so that<br> many of the mightiest of the king's thanes, that were in the<br> land, died within the three years. Of these, one was Swithulf<br> Bishop of Rochester, Ceolmund alderman in Kent, Bertulf alderman<br> in Essex, Wulfred alderman in Hampshire, Elhard Bishop of<br> Dorchester, Eadulf a king's thane in Sussex, Bernuff governor of<br> Winchester, and Egulf the king's horse-thane; and many also with<br> them; though I have named only the men of the highest rank. This<br> same year the plunderers in East-Anglia and Northumbria greatly<br> harassed the land of the West-Saxons by piracies on the southern<br> coast, but most of all by the esks which they built many years<br> before. Then King Alfred gave orders for building long ships<br> against the esks, which were full-nigh twice as long as the<br> others. Some had sixty oars, some more; and they were both<br> swifter and steadier, and also higher than the others. They were<br> not shaped either after the Frisian or the Danish model, but so<br> as he himself thought that they might be most serviceable. Then,<br> at a certain turn of this same year, came six of their ships to<br> the Isle of Wight; and going into Devonshire, they did much<br> mischief both there and everywhere on the seacoast. Then<br> commanded the king his men to go out against them with nine of<br> the new ships, and prevent their escape by the mouth of the river<br> to the outer sea. Then came they out against them with three<br> ships, and three others were standing upwards above the mouth on<br> dry land: for the men were gone off upon shore. Of the first<br> three ships they took two at the mouth outwards, and slew the<br> men; the third veered off, but all the men were slain except<br> five; and they too were severely wounded. Then came onward those<br> who manned the other ships, which were also very uneasily<br> situated. Three were stationed on that side of the deep where<br> the Danish ships were aground, whilst the others were all on the<br> opposite side; so that none of them could join the rest; for the<br> water had ebbed many furlongs from them. Then went the Danes<br> from their three ships to those other three that were on their<br> side, be-ebbed; and there they then fought. There were slain<br> Lucomon, the king's reve, and Wulfheard, a Frieslander; Ebb, a<br> Frieslander, and Ethelere, a Frieslander; and Ethelferth, the<br> king's neat-herd; and of all the men, Frieslanders and English,<br> sixty-two; of the Danes a hundred and twenty. The tide, however,<br> reached the Danish ships ere the Christians could shove theirs<br> out; whereupon they rowed them out; but they were so crippled,<br> that they could not row them beyond the coast of Sussex: there<br> two of them the sea drove ashore; and the crew were led to<br> Winchester to the king, who ordered them to be hanged. The men<br> who escaped in the single ship came to East-Anglia, severely<br> wounded. This same year were lost no less than twenty ships, and<br> the men withal, on the southern coast.

After this, in the summer, betwixt gang-days<br> and midsummer, went King Edward with some of his force into<br> Essex, to Maldon; and encamped there the while that men built and<br> fortified the town of Witham. And many of the people submitted<br> to him, who were before under the power of the Danes. And some<br> of his force, meanwhile, built the fortress at Hertford on the<br> south side of the Lea. This year by the permission of God went<br> Ethelfleda, lady of Mercia, with all the Mercians to Tamworth;<br> and built the fort there in the fore-part of the summer; and<br> before Lammas that at Stafford: in the next year that at<br> Eddesbury, in the beginning of the summer; and the same year,<br> late in the autumn, that at Warwick.

After this went the<br> army all up; and would proceed yet on plunder against<br> Archenfield; but the men of Hertford met them, and of Glocester,<br> and of the nighest towns; and fought with them, and put them to<br> flight; and they slew the Earl Rhoald, and the brother of Ohter<br> the other earl, and many of the army.

Thence went they<br> to Dimmet, and then out to Ireland. This was in harvest.

This year, before Easter, King Edward ordered his men<br> to go to the town of Towcester, and to rebuild it. Then again,<br> after that, in the same year, during the gang-days, he ordered<br> the town of Wigmore to be repaired. The same summer, betwixt<br> Lammas and midsummer, the army broke their parole from<br> Northampton and from Leicester; and went thence northward to<br> Towcester, and fought against the town all day, and thought that<br> they should break into it; but the people that were therein<br> defended it, till more aid came to them; and the enemy then<br> abandoned the town, and went away. Then again, very soon after<br> this, they went out at night for plunder, and came upon men<br> unaware, and seized not a little, both in men and cattle, betwixt<br> Burnham-wood and Aylesbury. At the same time went the army from<br> Huntington and East-Anglia, and constructed that work at<br> Ternsford; which they inhabited and fortified; and abandoned the<br> other at Huntingdon; and thought that they should thence oft with<br> war and contention recover a good deal of this land. Thence they<br> advanced till they came to Bedford; where the men who were within<br> came out against them, and fought with them, and put them to<br> flight, and slew a good number of them. Then again, after this,<br> a great army yet collected itself from East-Anglia and from<br> Mercia, and went to the town of Wigmore; which they besieged<br> without, and fought against long in the day; and took the cattle<br> about it; but the men defended the town, who were within; and the<br> enemy left the town, and went away. After this, the same summer,<br> a large force collected itself in King Edward's dominions, from<br> the nighest towns that could go thither, and went to Temsford;<br> and they beset the town, and fought thereon; until they broke<br> into it, and slew the king, and Earl Toglos, and Earl Mann his<br> son, and his brother, and all them that were therein, and who<br> were resolved to defend it; and they took the others, and all<br> that was therein. After this, a great force collected soon in<br> harvest, from Kent, from Surrey, from Essex, and everywhere from<br> the nighest towns; and went to Colchester, and beset the town,<br> and fought thereon till they took it, and slew all the people,<br> and seized all that was therein; except those men who escaped<br> therefrom over the wall. After this again, this same harvest, a<br> great army collected itself from East-Anglia, both of the<br> land-forces and of the pirates, which they had enticed to their<br> assistance, and thought that they should wreak their vengeance.<br> They went to Maldon, and beset the town, and fought thereon,<br> until more aid came to the townsmen from without to help. The<br> enemy then abandoned the town, and went from it. And the men<br> went after, out of the town, and also those that came from<br> without to their aid; and put the army to flight, and slew many<br> hundreds of them, both of the pirates and of the others. Soon<br> after this, the same harvest, went King Edward with the<br> West-Saxon army to Passham; and sat there the while that men<br> fortified the town of Towcester with a stone wall. And there<br> returned to him Earl Thurferth, and the captains, and all the<br> army that belonged to Northampton northward to the Welland, and<br> sought him for their lord and protector. When this division of<br> the army went home, then went another out, and marched to the<br> town of Huntingdon; and repaired and renewed it, where it was<br> broken down before, by command of King Edward.

On the second year after he was consecrated, he<br> made many minsters; and drove out the clerks (43) from the<br> bishopric, because they would hold no rule, and set monks<br> therein. He made there two abbacies; one of monks, another of<br> nuns. That was all within Winchester. Then came he afterwards<br> to King Edgar, and requested that he would give him all the<br> minsters that heathen men had before destroyed; for that he would<br> renew them. This the king cheerfully granted; and the bishop<br> came then first to Ely, where St. Etheldritha lies, and ordered<br> the minster to be repaired; which he gave to a monk of his, whose<br> name was Britnoth, whom he consecrated abbot: and there he set<br> monks to serve God, where formerly were nuns. He then bought<br> many villages of the king, and made it very rich. Afterwards<br> came Bishop Athelwold to the minster called Medhamsted, which was<br> formerly ruined by heathen folk; but he found there nothing but<br> old walls, and wild woods. In the old walls at length he found<br> hid writings which Abbot Hedda had formerly written;--how King<br> Wulfhere and Ethelred his brother had wrought it, and how they<br> freed it against king and against bishop, and against all worldly<br> service; and how Pope Agatho confirmed it with his writ, as also<br> Archbishop Deusdedit. He then ordered the minster to be rebuilt;<br> and set there an abbot, who was called Aldulf; and made monks,<br> where before was nothing. He then came to the king, and let him<br> look at the writings which before were found; and the king then<br> answered and said: \"I Edgar grant and give to-day, before God and<br> before Archbishop Dunstan, freedom to St. Peter's minster at<br> Medhamsted, from king and from bishop; and all the thorps that<br> thereto lie; that is, Eastfield, and Dodthorp, and Eye, and<br> Paston.

These lands and al the others that<br> belong to the minster I bequeath clear; that is, with sack and<br> sock, toll and team, and infangthief; these privileges and all<br> others bequeath I clear to Christ and St. Peter. And I give the<br> two parts of Whittlesey-mere, with waters and with wears and<br> fens; and so through Meerlade along to the water that is called<br> Nen; and so eastward to Kingsdelf. And I will that there be a<br> market in the town itself, and that no other be betwixt Stamford<br> and Huntingdon. And I will that thus be given the toll;--first,<br> from Whittlesey-mere to the king's toll of Norman-cross<br> hundred; then backward again from Whittlesey-mere through<br> Meerlade along to the Nen, and as that river runs to Crowland;<br> and from Crowland to Must, and from Must to Kingsdelf and to<br> Whittlesey-mere.

Then, over midsummer, came the Danish fleet to<br> Sandwich, and did as they were wont; they barrowed and burned and<br> slew as they went. Then the king ordered out all the population<br> from Wessex and from Mercia; and they lay out all the harvest<br> under arms against the enemy; but it availed nothing more than it<br> had often done before. For all this the enemy went wheresoever<br> they would; and the expedition did the people more harm than<br> either any internal or external force could do. When winter<br> approached, then went the army home; and the enemy retired after<br> Martinmas to their quarters in the Isle of Wight, and provided<br> themselves everywhere there with what they wanted. Then, about<br> midwinter, they went to their ready farm, throughout Hampshire<br> into Berkshire, to Reading. And they did according to their<br> custom,--they lighted their camp-beacons as they advanced.<br> Thence they marched to Wallingford, which they entirely<br> destroyed, and passed one night at Cholsey. They then turned<br> along Ashdown to Cuckamsley-hill, and there awaited better cheer;<br> for it was often said, that if they sought Cuckamsley, they would<br> never get to the sea. But they went another way homeward. Then<br> was their army collected at Kennet; and they came to battle<br> there, and soon put the English force to flight; and afterwards<br> carried their spoil to the sea.

Meanwhile, so great was the fear of the enemy, that<br> no man could think or devise how to drive them from the land, or<br> hold this territory against them; for they had terribly marked<br> each shire in Wessex with fire and devastation.

This year were the ships ready, that we before spoke<br> about; and there were so many of them as never were in England<br> before, in any king's days, as books tell us. And they were all<br> transported together to Sandwich; that they should lie there, and<br> defend this land against any out-force. But we have not yet had<br> the prosperity and the honour, that the naval armament should be<br> useful to this land, any more than it often before was. It was<br> at this same time, or a little earlier, that Brihtric, brother of<br> Alderman Edric, bewrayed Wulnoth, the South-Saxon knight, father<br> of Earl Godwin, to the king; and he went into exile, and enticed<br> the navy, till he had with him twenty ships; with which he<br> plundered everywhere by the south coast, and wrought every kind<br> of mischief. When it was told the navy that they might easily<br> seize him, if they would look about them, then took Brihtric with<br> him eighty ships; and thought that he should acquire for himself<br> much reputation, by getting Wulnoth into his hands alive or dead.<br> But, whilst they were proceeding thitherward, there came such a<br> wind against them, as no man remembered before; which beat and<br> tossed the ships, and drove them aground; whereupon Wulnoth soon<br> came, and burned them. When this was known to the remaining<br> ships, where the king was, how the others fared, it was then as<br> if all were lost. The king went home, with the aldermen and the<br> nobility; and thus lightly did they forsake the ships; whilst the<br> men that were in them rowed them back to London. Thus lightly<br> did they suffer the labour of all the people to be in vain; nor<br> was the terror lessened, as all England hoped. When this naval<br> expedition was thus ended, then came, soon after Lammas, the<br> formidable army of the enemy, called Thurkill's army, to<br> Sandwich; and soon they bent their march to Canterbury; which<br> city they would quickly have stormed, had they not rather desired<br> peace; and all the men of East-Kent made peace with the army, and<br> gave them 3,000 pounds for security. The army soon after that<br> went about till they came to the Isle of Wight; and everywhere in<br> Sussex, and in Hampshire, and also in Berkshire, they plundered<br> and burned, as THEIR CUSTOM IS. (54) Then ordered the king to<br> summon out all the population, that men might hold firm against<br> them on every side; but nevertheless they marched as they<br> pleased. On one occasion the king had begun his march before<br> them, as they proceeded to their ships, and all the people were<br> ready to fall upon them; but the plan was then frustrated through<br> Alderman Edric, AS IT EVER IS STILL. Then after Martinmas they<br> went back again to Kent, and chose their winter-quarters on the<br> Thames; obtaining their provisions from Essex, and from the<br> shires that were next, on both sides of the Thames. And oft they<br> fought against the city of London; but glory be to God, that it<br> yet standeth firm: and they ever there met with ill fare. Then<br> after midwinter took they an excursion up through Chiltern, (55)<br> and so to Oxford; which city they burned, and plundered on both<br> sides of the Thames to their ships. Being fore-warned that there<br> was an army gathered against them at London, they went over at<br> Staines; and thus were they in motion all the winter, and in<br> spring, appeared again in Kent, and repaired their ships.<br>alderman<br>army<br>brother<br>burn<br>call<br>choose<br>coast<br>dead<br>defend<br>desire<br>drive<br>earl<br>enemy<br>exile<br>expedition<br>fall<br>father<br>fight<br>gather<br>glory<br>honour<br>king<br>knight<br>land<br>land_force<br>lie<br>lose<br>make_peace<br>man_remember<br>midwinter<br>naval<br>naval_armament<br>navy<br>obtain<br>peace<br>plunder<br>plunder_burn<br>population<br>proceed<br>provision<br>remain<br>security<br>seize<br>ship<br>speak<br>storm<br>suffer<br>summon<br>warn<br>wind<br>work", "A.D. 1010.

This<br> was on the day called the first of the Ascension of our Lord.<br> The East-Angles soon fled. Cambridgeshire stood firm against<br> them.

There were they horsed; and<br> afterwards took possession of East-Anglia, where they plundered<br> and burned three months; and then proceeded further into the wild<br> fens, slaying both men and cattle, and burning throughout the<br> fens. Thetford also they burned, and Cambridge; and afterwards<br> went back southward into the Thames; and the horsemen rode<br> towards the ships. Then went they west-ward into Oxfordshire,<br> and thence to Buckinghamshire, and so along the Ouse till they<br> came to Bedford, and so forth to Temsford, always burning as they<br> went. Then returned they to their ships with their spoil, which<br> they apportioned to the ships. When the king's army should have<br> gone out to meet them as they went up, then went they home; and<br> when they were in the east, then was the army detained in the<br> west; and when they were in the south, then was the army in the<br> north. Then all the privy council were summoned before the king,<br> to consult how they might defend this country. But, whatever was<br> advised, it stood not a month; and at length there was not a<br> chief that would collect an army, but each fled as he could: no<br> shire, moreover, would stand by another. Before the feast-day of<br> St. Andrew came the enemy to Northampton, and soon burned the<br> town, and took as much spoil thereabout as they would; and then<br> returned over the Thames into Wessex, and so by Cannings-marsh,<br> burning all the way.

This year sent the king and his council to the army,<br> and desired peace; promising them both tribute and provisions, on<br> condition that they ceased from plunder. They had now overrun<br> East-Anglia [1], and Essex [2], and Middlesex [3], and<br> Oxfordshire [4], and Cambridgeshire [5], and Hertfordshire [6],<br> and Buckinghamshire [7], and Bedfordshire [8], and half of<br> Huntingdonshire [9], and much of Northamptonshire [10]; and, to<br> the south of the Thames, all Kent, and Sussex, and Hastings, and<br> Surrey, and Berkshire, and Hampshire, and much of Wiltshire. All<br> these disasters befel us through bad counsels; that they would<br> not offer tribute in time, or fight with them; but, when they had<br> done most mischief, then entered they into peace and amity with<br> them. And not the less for all this peace, and amity, and<br> tribute, they went everywhere in troops; plundering, and<br> spoiling, and slaying our miserable people. In this year,<br> between the Nativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas, they beset<br> Canterbury, and entered therein through treachery; for Elfmar<br> delivered the city to them, whose life Archbishop Elfeah formerly<br> saved. And there they seized Archbishop Elfeah, and Elfward the<br> king's steward, and Abbess Leofruna, (56) and Bishop Godwin; and<br> Abbot Elfmar they suffered to go away. And they took therein all<br> the men, and husbands, and wives; and it was impossible for any<br> man to say how many they were; and in the city they continued<br> afterwards as long as they would.

This year came Alderman Edric, and all the oldest<br> counsellors of England, clerk and laity, to London before Easter,<br> which was then on the ides of April; and there they abode, over<br> Easter, until all the tribute was paid, which was 48,000 pounds.<br> Then on the Saturday was the army much stirred against the<br> bishop; because he would not promise them any fee, and forbade<br> that any man should give anything for him. They were also much<br> drunken; for there was wine brought them from the south. Then<br> took they the bishop, and led him to their hustings, on the eve<br> of the Sunday after Easter, which was the thirteenth before the<br> calends of May; and there they then shamefully killed him. They<br> overwhelmed him with bones and horns of oxen; and one of them<br> smote him with an axe-iron on the head; so that he sunk downwards<br> with the blow; and his holy blood fell on the earth, whilst his<br> sacred soul was sent to the realm of God. The corpse in the<br> morning was carried to London; and the bishops, Ednoth and<br> Elfhun, and the citizens, received him with all honour, and<br> buried him in St. Paul's minster; where God now showeth this holy<br> martyr's miracles. When the tribute was paid, and the peace-oaths<br> were sworn, then dispersed the army as widely as it was<br> before collected.

The year after that Archbishop Elfeah was martyred,<br> the king appointed Lifing to the archiepiscopal see of<br> Canterbury. And in the same year, before the month August, came<br> King Sweyne with his fleet to Sandwich; and very soon went about<br> East-Anglia into the Humber-mouth, and so upward along the Trent,<br> until he came to Gainsborough. Then soon submitted to him Earl<br> Utred, and all the Northumbrians, and all the people of Lindsey,<br> and afterwards the people of the Five Boroughs, and soon after<br> all the army to the north of Watling-street; and hostages were<br> given him from each shire. When he understood that all the<br> people were subject to him, then ordered he that his army should<br> have provision and horses; and he then went southward with his<br> main army, committing his ships and the hostages to his son<br> Knute. And after he came over Watling-street, they wrought the<br> greatest mischief that any army could do. Then he went to<br> Oxford; and the population soon submitted, and gave hostages;<br> thence to Winchester, where they did the same. Thence went they<br> eastward to London; and many of the party sunk in the Thames,<br> because they kept not to any bridge. When he came to the city,<br> the population would not submit; but held their ground in full<br> fight against him, because therein was King Ethelred, and<br> Thurkill with him. Then went King Sweyne thence to Wallingford;<br> and so over Thames westward to Bath, where he abode with his<br> army. Thither came Alderman Ethelmar, and all the western thanes<br> with him, and all submitted to Sweyne, and gave hostages. When<br> he had thus settled all, then went he northward to his ships; and<br> all the population fully received him, and considered him full<br> king. The population of London also after this submitted to him,<br> and gave hostages; because they dreaded that he would undo them.<br> Then bade Sweyne full tribute and forage for his army during the<br> winter; and Thurkill bade the same for the army that lay at<br> Greenwich: besides this, they plundered as oft as they would.<br> And when this nation could neither resist in the south nor in the<br> north, King Ethelred abode some while with the fleet that lay in<br> the Thames; and the lady (57) went afterwards over sea to her<br> brother Richard, accompanied by Elfsy, Abbot of Peterborough.<br> The king sent Bishop Elfun with the ethelings, Edward and Alfred,<br> over sea; that he might instruct them. Then went the king from<br> the fleet, about midwinter, to the Isle of Wight; and there abode<br> for the season; after which he went over sea to Richard, with<br> whom he abode till the time when Sweyne died. Whilst the lady<br> was with her brother beyond sea, Elfsy, Abbot of Peterborough,<br> who was there with her, went to the abbey called Boneval, where<br> St. Florentine's body lay; and there found a miserable place, a<br> miserable abbot, and miserable monks: because they had been<br> plundered.

This year King Sweyne ended his days at Candlemas,<br> the third day before the nones of February; and the same year<br> Elfwy, Bishop of York, was consecrated in London, on the festival<br> of St. Juliana. The fleet all chose Knute for king; whereupon<br> advised all the counsellors of England, clergy and laity, that<br> they should send after King Ethelred; saying, that no sovereign<br> was dearer to them than their natural lord, if he would govern<br> them better than he did before. Then sent the king hither his<br> son Edward, with his messengers; who had orders to greet all his<br> people, saying that he would be their faithful lord--would<br> better each of those things that they disliked--and that each<br> of the things should be forgiven which had been either done or<br> said against him; provided they all unanimously, without<br> treachery, turned to him. Then was full friendship established,<br> in word and in deed and in compact, on either side. And every<br> Danish king they proclaimed an outlaw for ever from England.<br> Then came King Ethelred home, in Lent, to his own people; and he<br> was gladly received by them all. Meanwhile, after the death of<br> Sweyne, sat Knute with his army in Gainsborough until Easter; and<br> it was agreed between him and the people of Lindsey, that they<br> should supply him with horses, and afterwards go out all together<br> and plunder. But King Ethelred with his full force came to<br> Lindsey before they were ready; and they plundered and burned,<br> and slew all the men that they could reach. Knute, the son of<br> Sweyne, went out with his fleet (so were the wretched people<br> deluded by him), and proceeded southward until he came to<br> Sandwich. There he landed the hostages that were given to his<br> father, and cut off their hands and ears and their noses.<br> Besides all these evils, the king ordered a tribute to the army<br> that lay at Greenwich, of 21,000 pounds.

This year was the great council at Oxford; where<br> Alderman Edric betrayed Sigferth and Morcar, the eldest thanes<br> belonging to the Seven Towns. He allured them into his bower,<br> where they were shamefully slain. Then the king took all their<br> possessions, and ordered the widow of Sigferth to be secured, and<br> brought within Malmsbury. After a little interval, Edmund<br> Etheling went and seized her, against the king's will, and had<br> her to wife. Then, before the Nativity of St. Mary, went the<br> etheling west-north into the Five Towns, (58) and soon plundered<br> all the property of Sigferth and Morcar; and all the people<br> submitted to him. At the same time came King Knute to Sandwich,<br> and went soon all about Kent into Wessex, until he came to the<br> mouth of the Frome; and then plundered in Dorset, and in<br> Wiltshire, and in Somerset. King Ethelred, meanwhile, lay sick<br> at Corsham; and Alderman Edric collected an army there, and<br> Edmund the etheling in the north. When they came together, the<br> alderman designed to betray Edmund the etheling, but he could<br> not; whereupon they separated without an engagement, and sheered<br> off from their enemies. Alderman Edric then seduced forty ships<br> from the king, and submitted to Knute. The West-Saxons also<br> submitted, and gave hostages, and horsed the army.

This year came King Knute with a marine force of one<br> hundred and sixty ships, and Alderman Edric with him, over the<br> Thames into Mercia at Cricklade; whence they proceeded to<br> Warwickshire, during the middle of the winter, and plundered<br> therein, and burned, and slew all they met. Then began Edmund<br> the etheling to gather an army, which, when it was collected,<br> could avail him nothing, unless the king were there and they had<br> the assistance of the citizens of London. The expedition<br> therefore was frustrated, and each man betook himself home.<br> After this, an army was again ordered, under full penalties, that<br> every person, however distant, should go forth; and they sent to<br> the king in London, and besought him to come to meet the army<br> with the aid that he could collect. When they were all<br> assembled, it succeeded nothing better than it often did before;<br> and, when it was told the king, that those persons would betray<br> him who ought to assist him, then forsook he the army, and<br> returned again to London. Then rode Edmund the etheling to Earl<br> Utred in Northumbria; and every man supposed that they would<br> collect an army King Knute; but they went into Stafforddhire, and<br> to Shrewsbury, and to Chester; and they plundered on their parts,<br> and Knute on his. He went out through Buckinghamshire to<br> Bedfordshire; thence to Huntingdonshire, and so into<br> Northamptonshire along the fens to Stamford. Thence into<br> Lincolnshire. Thence to Nottinghamshire; and so into Northumbria<br> toward York. When Utred understood this, he ceased from<br> plundering, and hastened northward, and submitted for need, and<br> all the Northumbrians with him; but, though he gave hostages, he<br> was nevertheless slain by the advice of Alderman Edric, and<br> Thurkytel, the son of Nafan, with him. After this, King Knute<br> appointed Eric earl over Northumbria, as Utred was; and then went<br> southward another way, all by west, till the whole army came,<br> before Easter, to the ships. Meantime Edmund Etheling went to<br> London to his father: and after Easter went King Knute with all<br> his ships toward London; but it happened that King Ethelred died<br> ere the ships came. He ended his days on St. George's day;<br> having held his kingdom in much tribulation and difficulty as<br> long as his life continued. After his decease, all the peers<br> that were in London, and the citizens, chose Edmund king; who<br> bravely defended his kingdom while his time was. Then came the<br> ships to Greenwich, about the gang-days, and within a short<br> interval went to London; where they sunk a deep ditch on the<br> south side, and dragged their ships to the west side of the<br> bridge. Afterwards they trenched the city without, so that no<br> man could go in or out, and often fought against it: but the<br> citizens bravely withstood them. King Edmund had ere this gone<br> out, and invaded the West-Saxons, who all submitted to him; and<br> soon afterward he fought with the enemy at Pen near Gillingham.<br> A second battle he fought, after midsummer, at Sherston; where<br> much slaughter was made on either side, and the leaders<br> themselves came together in the fight. Alderman Edric and Aylmer<br> the darling were assisting the army against King Edmund. Then<br> collected he his force the third time, and went to London, all by<br> north of the Thames, and so out through Clayhanger, and relieved<br> the citizens, driving the enemy to their ships. It was within<br> two nights after that the king went over at Brentford; where he<br> fought with the enemy, and put them to flight: but there many of<br> the English were drowned, from their own carelessness; who went<br> before the main army with a design to plunder. After this the<br> king went into Wessex, and collected his army; but the enemy soon<br> returned to London, and beset the city without, and fought<br> strongly against it both by water and land. But the almighty God<br> delivered them. The enemy went afterward from London with their<br> ships into the Orwell; where they went up and proceeded into<br> Mercia, slaying and burning whatsoever they overtook, as their<br> custom is; and, having provided themselves with meat, they drove<br> their ships and their herds into the Medway. Then assembled King<br> Edmund the fourth time all the English nation, and forded over<br> the Thames at Brentford; whence he proceeded into Kent. The<br> enemy fled before him with their horses into the Isle of Shepey;<br> and the king slew as many of them as he could overtake. Alderman<br> Edric then went to meet the king at Aylesford; than which no<br> measure could be more ill-advised. The enemy, meanwhile,<br> returned into Essex, and advanced into Mercia, destroying all<br> that he overtook. When the king understood that the army was up,<br> then collected he the fifth time all the English nation, and went<br> behind them, and overtook them in Essex, on the down called<br> Assingdon; where they fiercely came together. Then did Alderman<br> Edric as he often did before--he first began the flight with<br> the Maisevethians, and so betrayed his natural lord and all the<br> people of England. There had Knute the victory, though all<br> England fought against him! There was then slain Bishop Ednoth,<br> and Abbot Wulsy, and Alderman Elfric, and Alderman Godwin of<br> Lindsey, and Ulfkytel of East-Anglia, and Ethelward, the son of<br> Alderman Ethelsy (59). And all the nobility of the English<br> nation was there undone! After this fight went King Knute up<br> with his army into Glocestershire, where he heard say that King<br> Edmund was. Then advised Alderman Edric, and the counsellors<br> that were there assembled, that the kings should make peace with<br> each other, and produce hostages. Then both the kings met<br> together at Olney, south of Deerhurst, and became allies and<br> sworn brothers. There they confirmed their friendship both with<br> pledges and with oaths, and settled the pay of the army. With<br> this covenant they parted: King Edmund took to Wessex, and Knute<br> to Mercia and the northern district. The army then went to their<br> ships with the things they had taken; and the people of London<br> made peace with them, and purchased their security, whereupon<br> they brought their ships to London, and provided themselves<br> winter-quarters therein. On the feast of St. Andrew died King<br> Edmund; and he is buried with his grandfather Edgar at<br> Gastonbury.

The Danes then<br> gave him much money, and received him as king. The same year<br> Magnus died.

This year died Athelstan,<br> Abbot of Abingdon, and Sparhawk, monk of St. Edmund's-bury,<br> succeeded him. And in this same year died bishop Siward, and<br> Archbishop Eadsine again obtained the whole bishopric. And in<br> this same year Lothen and Irling came with twenty-five ships to<br> Sandwich, and there took unspeakable booty, in men, and in gold,<br> and in silver, so that no man knew how much it all was.

And<br> they betook themselves then east to Baldwine's land, and there<br> they sold what they had plundered; and after that went their way<br> east, whence they before had come.

And in this same year King Edward went out to<br> Sandwich with a great fleet. And Sweyn the earl, son of Godwin<br> the earl, came in to Bosham with seven ships; and he obtained the<br> king's protection, and he was promised that he should be held<br> worthy of everything which he before possessed. Then Harold the<br> earl, his brother, and Beorn the earl contended that he should<br> not be held worthy of any of the things which the king had<br> granted to them: but a protection of four days was appointed him<br> to go to his ships. Then befell it during this, that word came<br> to the king that hostile ships lay westward, and were ravaging.<br> Then went Godwin the earl west about with two of the king's<br> ships; the one commanded Harold the earl, and the other Tosty his<br> brother; and forty-two of the people's ships. Then Harold the<br> earl was removed from the king's ship which Harold the earl<br> before had commanded. Then went they west to Pevensey, and lay<br> there weather-bound. Upon this, after two days, then came Sweyn<br> the earl thither, and spoke with his father, and with Beorn the<br> earl, and begged of Beorn that he would go with him to the king<br> at Sandwich, and help him to the king's friendship: and he<br> granted it.

This year was the severe winter: and this year died<br> Alwyn, Bishop of Winchester, and Bishop Stigand was raised to his<br> see. And before that, in the same year, died Grinketel, Bishop<br> in Sussex, and Heca the priest succeeded to the bishopric. And<br> Sweyn also sent hither, begging assistance against Magnus, King<br> of Norway; that fifty ships should be sent to his aid. But it<br> seemed unadvisable to all people: and it was then hindered by<br> reason that Magnus had a great ship-force. And he then drove out<br> Sweyn, and with much man-slaying won the land: and the Danes paid<br> him much money and acknowledged him as king. And that same year<br> Magnus died. In this year King Edward appointed Robert, of<br> London, Archbishop of Canterbury, during Lent. And in the same<br> Lent he went to Rome after his pall: and the king gave the<br> bishopric of London to Sparhafoc, Abbot of Abingdon; and the king<br> gave the abbacy of Abingdon to Bishop Rodulf, his kinsman. Then<br> came the archbishop from Rome one day before St. Peter's mass-eve,<br> and entered on his archiepiscopal see at Christ's Church on<br> St. Peter's mass-day; and soon after went to the king. Then came<br> Abbot Sparhafoc to him with the king's writ and seal, in order<br> that he should consecrate him Bishop of London. Then the<br> archbishop refused, and said that the pope had forbidden it him.<br> Then went the abbot to the archbishop again for that purpose, and<br> there desired episcopal ordination; and the archbishop constantly<br> refused him, and said that the pope had forbidden it him. Then<br> went the abbot to London, and occupied the bishopric which the<br> king before had granted him, with his full leave, all the summer<br> and the harvest. And then came Eustace [Earl of Boulogne] from<br> beyond sea soon after the bishop, and went to the king, and spoke<br> with him that which he then would, and went then homeward. When<br> he came to Canterbury, east, then took he refreshment there, and<br> his men, and went to Dover. When he was some mile or more, on<br> this side of Dover, then he put on his breast-plate, and so did<br> all his companions, and went to Dover. When they came thither,<br> then would they lodge themselves where they chose. Then came one<br> of his men, and would abide in the house of a householder against<br> his will, and wounded the householder; and the householder slew<br> the other. Then Eustace got upon his horse, and his companions<br> upon theirs; and they went to the householder, and slew him<br> within his own dwelling; and they went up towards the town, and<br> slew, as well within as without, more than twenty men. And the<br> townsmen slew nineteen men on the other side, and wounded they<br> knew not how many. And Eustace escaped with a few men, and went<br> again to the king, and made known to him, in part, how they had<br> fared. And the king became very wroth with the townsmen. And<br> the king sent off Godwin the earl, and bade him go into Kent in a<br> hostile manner to Dover: for Eustace had made it appear to the<br> king, that it had been more the fault of the townsmen than his:<br> but it was not so. And the earl would not consent to the inroad,<br> because he was loth to injure his own people. Then the king sent<br> after all his council, and bade them come to Gloucester, nigh the<br> aftermass of St. Mary. Then had the Welshmen erected a castle in<br> Herefordshire among the people of Sweyn the earl, and wrought<br> every kind of harm and disgrace to the king's men there about<br> which they could. Then came Godwin the earl, and Sweyn the earl,<br> and Harold the earl, together at Beverstone, and many men with<br> them, in order that they might go to their royal lord, and to all<br> the peers who were assembled with him, in order that they might<br> have the advice of the king and his aid, and of all this council,<br> how they might avenge the king's disgrace, and the whole<br> nation's. Then were the Welshmen with the king beforehand, and<br> accused the earls, so that they might not come within his eyes'<br> sight; because they said that they were coming thither in order<br> to betray the king. Thither had come Siward the earl [Of<br> Northumbria] and Leofric the earl [Of Mercia], and much people<br> with them, from the north, to the king; and it was made known to<br> the Earl Godwin and his sons, that the king and the men who were<br> with him, were taking counsel concerning them: and they arrayed<br> themselves on the other hand resolutely, though it were loathful<br> to them that they should stand against their royal lord. Then<br> the peers on either side decreed that every kind of evil should<br> cease: and the king gave the peace of God and his full friendship<br> to either side. Then the king and his peers decreed that a<br> council of all the nobles should be held for the second time in<br> London at the harvest equinox; and the king directed the army to<br> be called out, as well south of the Thames as north, all that was<br> in any way most eminent. Then declared they Sweyn the earl an<br> outlaw, and summoned Godwin the earl and Harold the earl, to the<br> council, as quickly as they could effect it. When they had come<br> thither, then were they summoned into the council. Then required<br> he safe conduct and hostages, so that he might come, unbetrayed,<br> into the council and out of the council. Then the king demanded<br> all the thanes whom the earls before had: and they granted them<br> all into his hands. Then the king sent again to them, and<br> commanded them that they should come with twelve men to the<br> king's council. Then the earl again required safe conduct and<br> hostages, that he might defend himself against each of those<br> things which were laid to him. Then were the hostages refused<br> him; and he was allowed a safe conduct for five nights to go out<br> of the land. And then Godwin the earl and Sweyn the earl went to<br> Bosham, and shoved out their ships, and betook themselves beyond<br> sea, and sought Baldwin's protection, and abode there all the<br> winter. And Harold the earl went west to Ireland, and was there<br> all the winter within the king's protection. And soon after this<br> happened, then put away the king the lady who had been<br> consecrated his queen [Editha], and caused to be taken from her<br> all which she possessed, in land, and in gold, and in silver, and<br> in all things, and delivered her to his sister at Wherwell. And<br> Abbot Sparhafoc was then driven out of the bishopric of London,<br> and William the king's priest was ordained thereto.

(62) This year the emperor gathered an innumerable<br> army against Baldwin of Bruges, because he had destroyed the<br> palace of Nimeguen, and because of many other ungracious acts<br> that he did against him. The army was immense that he had<br> collected together. There was Leo, the Pope of Rome, and the<br> patriarch, and many other great men of several provinces. He<br> sent also to King Edward, and requested of him naval aid, that he<br> might not permit him to escape from him by water. Whereupon he<br> went to Sandwich, and lay there with a large naval armament,<br> until the emperor had all that he wished of Baldwin. Thither<br> also came back again Earl Sweyne, who had gone from this land to<br> Denmark, and there ruined his cause with the Danes. He came<br> hither with a pretence, saying that he would again submit to the<br> king, and be his man; and he requested Earl Beorn to be of<br> assistance to him, and give him land to feed him on. But Harold,<br> his brother, and Earl Beorn resisted, and would give him nothing<br> of that which the king had given them. The king also refused him<br> everything. Whereupon Swevne retired to his ships at Bosham.<br> Then, after the settlement between the emperor and Baldwin, many<br> ships went home, and the king remained behind Sandwich with a few<br> ships. Earl Godwin also sailed forty-two ships from Sandwich to<br> Pevensey, and Earl Beorn went with him. Then the king gave leave<br> to all the Mercians to return home, and they did so. Then it was<br> told the king that Osgod lay at Ulps with thirty-nine ships;<br> whereupon the king sent after the ships that he might dispatch,<br> which before had gone homewards, but still lay at the Nore. Then<br> Osgod fetched his wife from Bruges; and they went back again with<br> six ships; but the rest went towards Essex, to Eadulf's-ness, and<br> there plundered, and then returned to their ships. But there<br> came upon them a strong wind, so that they were all lost but four<br> persons, who were afterwards slain beyond sea. Whilst Earl<br> Godwin and Earl Beorn lay at Pevensey with their ships, came Earl<br> Sweyne, and with a pretence requested of Earl Beorn, who was his<br> uncle's son, that he would be his companion to the king at<br> Sandwich, and better his condition with him; adding, that he<br> would swear oaths to him, and be faithful to him. Whereupon<br> Beorn concluded, that he would not for their relationship betray<br> him. He therefore took three companions with him, and they rode<br> to Bosham, where his (63) ships lay, as though they should<br> proceed to Sandwich; but they suddenly bound him, and led him to<br> the ships, and went thence with him to Dartmouth, where they<br> ordered him to be slain and buried deep. He was afterwards<br> found, and Harold his cousin fetched him thence, and led him to<br> Winchester, to the old minster, where he buried him with King<br> Knute, his uncle. Then the king and all the army proclaimed<br> Sweyne an outlaw. A little before this the men of Hastings and<br> thereabout fought his two ships with their ships, and slew all<br> the men, and brought the ships to Sandwich to the king. Eight<br> ships had he, ere he betrayed Beorn; afterwards they all forsook<br> him except two; whereupon he went eastward to the land of<br> Baldwin, and sat there all the winter at Bruges, in full<br> security. In the same year came up from Ireland thirty-six ships<br> on the Welsh coast, and thereabout committed outrages, with the<br> aid of Griffin, the Welsh king. The people were soon gathered<br> against them, and there was also with them Bishop Eldred, but<br> they had too little assistance, and the enemy came unawares on<br> them very early in the morning, and slew on the spot many good<br> men; but the others burst forth with the bishop. This was done<br> on the fourth day before the calends of August. This year died<br> the good Bishop Ednoth in Oxfordshire; and Oswy, Abbot of Thomey;<br> and Wulfnoth, Abbot of Westminster; and King Edward gave the<br> bishopric which Ednoth had to Ulf his priest, but it ill betided<br> him; and he was driven from it, because he did nought like a<br> bishop therein, so that it shameth us now to say more. Bishop<br> Siward also died who lies at Abingdon. In this same year King<br> Edward put nine ships out of pay; and the crews departed, and<br> went away with the ships withal, leaving five ships only behind,<br> for whom the king ordered twelve months pay. The same year went<br> Bishops Hereman and Aldred to the pope at Rome on the king's<br> errand. This year was also consecrated the great minster at<br> Rheims, in the presence of Pope Leo and the emperor. There was<br> also a great synod at St. Remy; (64) at which was present Pope<br> Leo, with the Archbishops of Burgundy, of Besancon, of Treves,<br> and of Rheims; and many wise men besides, both clergy and laity.<br> A great synod there held they respecting the service of God, at<br> the instance of St. Leo the pope.

While Godwin the<br> earl and Beorn the earl lay at Pevensey, then came Sweyn the<br> earl, and begged Beorn the earl, with fraud, who was his uncle's<br> son, that he would be his companion to the king at Sandwich, and<br> better his affairs with him. He went then, on account of the<br> relationship, with three companions, with him; and he led him<br> then towards Bosham, where his ships lay: and then they bound<br> him, and led him on ship-board. Then went he thence with him to<br> Dartmouth, and there ordered him to be slain, and deeply buried.<br> Afterwards he was found, and borne to Winchester, and buried with<br> king Canute his uncle. A little before that, the men of Hastings<br> and thereabout, fought two of his ships with their ships; and<br> slew all the men, and brought the ships to Sandwich to the king.<br> Eight ships he had before he betrayed Beorn; after that all<br> forsook him except two. In the same year arrived in the Welsh<br> Axa, from Ireland, thirty-six ships, and thereabout did harm,<br> with the help of Griffin the Welsh king. The people were<br> gathered together against them; Bishop Aldred [Of Worchester] was<br> also there with them; but they had too little power. And they<br> came unawares upon them at very early morn; and there they slew<br> many good men, and the others escaped with the bishop: this was<br> done on the fourth before the kalends of August. This year died,<br> in Oxfordshire, Oswy, Abbot of Thorney, and Wulfnoth, Abbot of<br> Westminster; and Ulf the priest was appointed as pastor to the<br> bishopric which Eadnoth had held; but he was after that driven<br> away; because he did nothing bishop-like therein: so that it<br> shameth us now to tell more about it. And Bishop Siward died: he<br> lieth at Abingdon. And this year was consecrated the great<br> minster at Rheims: there was Pope Leo [IX.] and the emperor<br> [Henry III]; and there they held a great synod concerning God's<br> service. St. Leo the pope presided at the synod: it is difficult<br> to have a knowledge of the bishops who came there, and how many<br> abbots: and hence, from this land were sent two--from St.<br> Augustine's and from Ramsey.))<br>abbot<br>account<br>appoint<br>assistance<br>beg<br>betray<br>bishop<br>bishopric<br>bury<br>companion<br>concern<br>consecrate<br>crew<br>destroy<br>die<br>do_harm<br>drive<br>earl<br>emperor<br>escape<br>fight<br>forsook<br>good_man<br>king<br>land<br>lie<br>minster<br>people_gather<br>pope<br>priest<br>promise<br>remain<br>sea<br>service<br>ship<br>slay<br>slew<br>son<br>synod<br>uncle<br>wife<br>wind", "A.D. 1051. This year came Archbishop Robert hither over sea with<br> his pall from Rome, one day before St. Peter's eve: and he took<br> his archiepiscopal seat at Christ-church on St. Peter's day, and<br> soon after this went to the king. Then came Abbot Sparhawk to<br> him with the king's writ and seal, to the intent that he should<br> consecrate him Bishop o[oe] London; but the archbishop refused,<br> saying that the pope had forbidden him. Then went the abbot to<br> the archbishop again for the same purpose, and there demanded<br> episcopal consecration; but the archbishop obstinately refused,<br> repeating that the pope had forbidden him. Then went the abbot<br> to London, and sat at the bishopric which the king had before<br> given him, with his full leave, all the summer and the autumn.<br> Then during the same year came Eustace, who had the sister of<br> King Edward to wife, from beyond sea, soon after the bishop, and<br> went to the king; and having spoken with him whatever he chose,<br> he then went homeward. When he came to Canterbury eastward,<br> there took he a repast, and his men; whence he proceeded to<br> Dover. When he was about a mile or more on this side Dover, he<br> put on his breast-plate; and so did all his companions: and they<br> proceeded to Dover. When they came thither, they resolved to<br> quarter themselves wherever they lived. Then came one of his<br> men, and would lodge at the house of a master of a family against<br> his will; but having wounded the master of the house, he was<br> slain by the other. Then was Eustace quickly upon his horse, and<br> his companions upon theirs; and having gone to the master of the<br> family, they slew him on his own hearth; then going up to the<br> boroughward, they slew both within and without more than twenty<br> men. The townsmen slew nineteen men on the other side, and<br> wounded more, but they knew not how many. Eustace escaped with a<br> few men, and went again to the king, telling him partially how<br> they had fared. The king was very wroth with the townsmen, and<br> sent off Earl Godwin, bidding him go into Kent with hostility to<br> Dover. For Eustace had told the king that the guilt of the<br> townsmen was greater than his. But it was not so: and the earl<br> would not consent to the expedition, because he was loth to<br> destroy his own people. Then sent the king after all his<br> council, and bade them come to Gloucester nigh the after-mass of<br> St. Mary. Meanwhile Godwin took it much to heart, that in his<br> earldom such a thing should happen. Whereupon be began to gather<br> forces over all his earldom, and Earl Sweyne, his son, over his;<br> and Harold, his other son, over his earldom: and they assembled<br> all in Gloucestershire, at Langtree, a large and innumerable<br> army, all ready for battle against the king; unless Eustace and<br> his men were delivered to them handcuffed, and also the Frenchmen<br> that were in the castle. This was done seven nights before the<br> latter mass of St. Mary, when King Edward was sitting at<br> Gloucester. Whereupon he sent after Earl Leofric, and north<br> after Earl Siward, and summoned their retinues. At first they<br> came to him with moderate aid; but when they found how it was in<br> the south, then sent they north over all their earldom, and<br> ordered a large force to the help of their lord. So did Ralph<br> also over his earldom. Then came they all to Gloucester to<br> the aid of the king, though it was late. So unanimous were they<br> all in defence of the king, that they would seek Godwin's army if<br> the king desired it. But some prevented that; because it was<br> very unwise that they should come together; for in the two armies<br> was there almost all that was noblest in England. They therefore<br> prevented this, that they might not leave the land at the mercy<br> of our foes, whilst engaged in a destructive conflict betwixt<br> ourselves. Then it was advised that they should exchange<br> hostages between them. And they issued proclamations throughout<br> to London, whither all the people were summoned over all this<br> north end in Siward's earldom, and in Leofric's, and also<br> elsewhere; and Earl Godwin was to come thither with his sons to a<br> conference; They came as far as Southwark, and very many with<br> them from Wessex; but his army continually diminished more and<br> more; for they bound over to the king all the thanes that<br> belonged to Earl Harold his son, and outlawed Earl Sweyne his<br> other son. When therefore it could not serve his purpose to come<br> to a conference against the king and against the army that was<br> with him, he went in the night away. In the morning the king<br> held a council, and proclaimed him an outlaw, with his whole<br> army; himself and his wife, and all his three sons--Sweyne and<br> Tosty and Grith. And he went south to Thorney, (67) with his<br> wife, and Sweyne his son, and Tosty and his wife, a cousin of<br> Baldwin of Bruges, and his son Grith. Earl Harold with Leofwine<br> went to Bristol in the ship that Earl Sweyne had before prepared<br> and provisioned for himself; and the king sent Bishop Aldred from<br> London with his retinue, with orders to overtake him ere he came<br> to ship. But they either could not or would not: and he then<br> went out from the mouth of the Avon; but he encountered such<br> adverse weather, that he got off with difficulty, and suffered<br> great loss. He then went forth to Ireland, as soon as the<br> weather permitted. In the meantime the Welshmen had wrought a<br> castle in Herefordshire, in the territory of Earl Sweyne, and<br> brought as much injury and disgrace on the king's men thereabout<br> as they could. Then came Earl Godwin, and Earl Sweyne, and Earl<br> Harold, together at Beverstone, and many men with them; to the<br> intent that they might go to their natural lord, and to all the<br> peers that were assembled with him; to have the king's counsel<br> and assistance, and that of all the peers, how they might avenge<br> the insult offered to the king, and to all the nation. But the<br> Welshmen were before with the king, and bewrayed the earls, so<br> that they were not permitted to come within the sight of his<br> eyes; for they declared that they intended to come thither to<br> betray the king. There was now assembled before the king (68)<br> Earl Siward, and Earl Leofric, and much people with them from the<br> north: and it was told Earl Godwin and his sons, that the king<br> and the men who were with him would take counsel against them;<br> but they prepared themselves firmly to resist, though they were<br> loth to proceed against their natural lord. Then advised the<br> peers on either side, that they should abstain from all<br> hostility: and the king gave God's peace and his full friendship<br> to each party. Then advised the king and his council, that there<br> should be a second time a general assembly of all the nobles in<br> London, at the autumnal equinox: and the king ordered out an army<br> both south and north of the Thames, the best that ever was. Then<br> was Earl Sweyne proclaimed an outlaw; and Earl Godwin and Earl<br> Harold were summoned to the council as early as they could come.<br> When they came thither and were cited to the council, then<br> required they security and hostages, that they might come into<br> the council and go out without treachery. The king then demanded<br> all the thanes that the earls had; and they put them all into his<br> hands. Then sent the king again to them, and commanded them to<br> come with twelve men to the king's council. Then desired the<br> earl again security and hostages, that he might answer singly to<br> each of the things that were laid to his charge. But the<br> hostages were refused; and a truce of five nights was allowed him<br> to depart from the land. Then went Earl Godwin and Earl Sweyne<br> to Bosham, and drew out their ships, and went beyond sea, seeking<br> the protection of Baldwin; and there they abode all the winter.<br> Earl Harold went westward to Ireland, and was there all the<br> winter on the king's security. It was from Thorney (69) that<br> Godwin and those that were with him went to Bruges, to Baldwin's<br> land, in one ship, with as much treasure as they could lodge<br> therein for each man. Wonderful would it have been thought by<br> every man that was then in England, if any person had said before<br> this that it would end thus! For he was before raised to such a<br> height, that he ruled the king and all England; his sons were<br> earls, and the king's darlings; and his daughter wedded and<br> united to the king. Soon after this took place, the king<br> dismissed the lady who had been consecrated his queen, and<br> ordered to be taken from her all that she had in land, and in<br> gold, and in silver, and in all things; and committed her to the<br> care of his sister at Wherwell. Soon after came Earl William<br> from beyond sea with a large retinue of Frenchmen; and the king<br> entertained him and as many of his companions as were convenient<br> to him, and let him depart again. Then was Abbot Sparhawk driven<br> from his bishopric at London; and William the king's priest was<br> invested therewith. Then was Oddy appointed earl over<br> Devonshire, and over Somerset, and over Dorset, and over Wales;<br> and Algar, the son of Earl Leofric, was promoted to the earldom<br> which Harold before possessed.<br>abbot<br>abode<br>advise<br>aid<br>allow<br>appoint<br>archbishop<br>archiepiscopal<br>army<br>assemble<br>assistance<br>battle<br>betray<br>betwixt<br>bishop<br>bishopric<br>castle<br>choose<br>church<br>command<br>commit<br>companion<br>conflict<br>consecrate<br>consecrate_bishop<br>consecration<br>consent<br>council<br>counsel<br>cousin<br>daughter<br>declare<br>deliver<br>demand<br>depart<br>desire<br>destroy<br>difficulty<br>drive_bishopric<br>earl<br>engage<br>entertain<br>episcopal<br>ere<br>escape<br>expedition<br>full_friendship<br>go_homeward<br>go_sea<br>gold_silver<br>horse<br>hostage<br>hostility<br>invest<br>king<br>land<br>large_army<br>leave<br>lord<br>mass<br>master<br>mouth<br>nation<br>noble<br>offer<br>outlaw<br>overtake<br>pall<br>peace<br>pope<br>possess<br>priest<br>proceed<br>provision<br>refuse<br>rule<br>sea<br>security<br>seek<br>ship<br>sister<br>sit<br>slay<br>slew<br>son<br>speak<br>suffer<br>summon<br>territory<br>thane<br>townsman<br>treachery<br>treasure<br>truce<br>weather<br>whole_army<br>wife<br>work_castle<br>wound", "((A.D. 1051.

This year, on the second day before the nones of<br> March, died the aged Lady Elfgiva Emma, the mother of King Edward<br> and of King Hardacnute, the relict of King Ethelred and of King<br> Knute; and her body lies in the old minster with King Knute. At<br> this time Griffin, the Welsh king, plundered in Herefordshire<br> till he came very nigh to Leominster; and they gathered against<br> him both the landsmen and the Frenchmen from the castle; and<br> there were slain very many good men of the English, and also of<br> the French. This was on the same day thirteen years after that<br> Edwin was slain with his companions. In the same year advised<br> the king and his council, that ships should be sent out to<br> Sandwich, and that Earl Ralph and Earl Odda should be appointed<br> headmen thereto. Then went Earl Godwin out from Bruges with his<br> ships to Ysendyck; and sailed forth one day before midsummer-eve,<br> till he came to the Ness that is to the south of Romney. When it<br> came to the knowledge of the earls out at Sandwich, they went out<br> after the other ships; and a land-force was also ordered out<br> against the ships. Meanwhile Earl Godwin had warning, and betook<br> himself into Pevensey: and the weather was so boisterous, that<br> the earls could not learn what had become of Earl Godwin. But<br> Earl Godwin then went out again until he came back to Bruges; and<br> the other ships returned back again to Sandwich. Then it was<br> advised that the ships should go back again to London, and that<br> other earls and other pilots should be appointed over them. But<br> it was delayed so long that the marine army all deserted; and<br> they all betook themselves home. When Earl Godwin understood<br> that, he drew up his sail and his ship: and they (70) went west<br> at once to the Isle of Wight; and landing there, they plundered<br> so long that the people gave them as much as they required of<br> them. Then proceeded they westward until they came to Portland,<br> where they landed and did as much harm as they could possibly do.<br> Meanwhile Harold had gone out from Ireland with nine ships, and<br> came up at Potlock with his ships to the mouth of the Severn,<br> near the boundaries of Somerset and Devonshire, and there<br> plundered much. The land-folk collected against him, both from<br> Somerset and from Devonshire: but he put them to flight, and slew<br> there more than thirty good thanes, besides others; and went soon<br> after about Penwithstert, where was much people gathered against<br> him; but he spared not to provide himself with meat, and went up<br> and slew on the spot a great number of the people--seizing in<br> cattle, in men, and in money, whatever he could. Then went he<br> eastward to his father; and they went both together eastward (71)<br> until they came to the Isle of Wight, where they seized whatever<br> had been left them before. Thence they went to Pevensey, and got<br> out with them as many ships as had gone in there, and so<br> proceeded forth till they came to the Ness; (72) getting all the<br> ships that were at Romney, and at Hithe, and at Folkstone. Then<br> ordered King Edward to fit out forty smacks that lay at Sandwich<br> many weeks, to watch Earl Godwin, who was at Bruges during the<br> winter; but he nevertheless came hither first to land, so as to<br> escape their notice. And whilst he abode in this land, he<br> enticed to him all the Kentish men, and all the boatmen from<br> Hastings, and everywhere thereabout by the sea-coast, and all the<br> men of Essex and Sussex and Surrey, and many others besides.<br> Then said they all that they would with him live or die. When<br> the fleet that lay at Sandwich had intelligence about Godwin's<br> expedition, they set sail after him; but he escaped them, and<br> betook himself wherever he might: and the fleet returned to<br> Sandwich, and so homeward to London. When Godwin understood that<br> the fleet that lay at Sandwich was gone home, then went he back<br> again to the Isle of Wight, and lay thereabout by the sea-coast<br> so long that they came together--he and his son Earl Harold.<br> But they did no great harm after they came together; save that<br> they took meat, and enticed to them all the land-folk by the<br> sea-coast and also upward in the land. And they proceeded toward<br> Sandwich, ever alluring forth with them all the boatmen that they<br> met; and to Sandwich they came with an increasing army. They<br> then steered eastward round to Dover, and landing there, took as<br> many ships and hostages as they chose, and so returned to<br> Sandwich, where they did the same; and men everywhere gave them<br> hostages and provisions, wherever they required them. Then<br> proceeded they to the Nore, and so toward London; but some of the<br> ships landed on the Isle of Shepey, and did much harm there;<br> whence they steered to Milton Regis, and burned it all, and then<br> proceeded toward London after the earls. When they came to<br> London, there lay the king and all his earls to meet them, with<br> fifty ships. The earls (73) then sent to the king, praying that<br> they might be each possessed of those things which had been<br> unjustly taken from them. But the king resisted some while; so<br> long that the people who were with the earl were very much<br> stirred against the king and against his people, so that the earl<br> himself with difficulty appeased them. When King Edward<br> understood that, then sent he upward after more aid; but they<br> came very late. And Godwin stationed himself continually before<br> London with his fleet, till he came to Southwark; where he abode<br> some time, until the flood (74) came up. On this occasion he<br> also contrived with the burgesses that they should do almost all<br> that he would. When he had arranged his whole expedition, then<br> came the flood; and they soon weighed anchor, and steered through<br> the bridge by the south side. The land-force meanwhile came<br> above, and arranged themselves by the Strand; and they formed<br> an angle with the ships against the north side, as if they wished<br> to surround the king's ships. The king had also a great<br> land-force on his side, to add to his shipmen: but they were most of<br> them loth to fight with their own kinsmen--for there was little<br> else of any great importance but Englishmen on either side; and<br> they were also unwilling that this land should be the more<br> exposed to outlandish people, because they destroyed each other.<br> Then it was determined that wise men should be sent between them,<br> who should settle peace on either side. Godwin went up, and<br> Harold his son, and their navy, as many as they then thought<br> proper. Then advanced Bishop Stigand with God's assistance, and<br> the wise men both within the town and without; who determined<br> that hostages should be given on either side. And so they did.<br> When Archbishop Robert and the Frenchmen knew that, they took<br> horse; and went some west to Pentecost Castle, some north to<br> Robert's castle. Archbishop Robert and Bishop Ulf, with their<br> companions, went out at Eastgate, slaying or else maiming many<br> young men, and betook themselves at once to Eadulf's-ness; where<br> he put himself on board a crazy ship, and went at once over sea,<br> leaving his pall and all Christendom here on land, as God<br> ordained, because he had obtained an honour which God disclaimed.<br> Then was proclaimed a general council without London; and all the<br> earls and the best men in the land were at the council. There<br> took up Earl Godwin his burthen, and cleared himself there before<br> his lord King Edward, and before all the nation; proving that he<br> was innocent of the crime laid to his charge, and to his son<br> Harold and all his children. And the king gave the earl and his<br> children, and all the men that were with him, his full<br> friendship, and the full earldom, and all that he possessed<br> before; and he gave the lady all that she had before. Archbishop<br> Robert was fully proclaimed an outlaw, with all the Frenchmen;<br> because they chiefly made the discord between Earl Godwin and the<br> king: and Bishop Stigand succeeded to the archbishopric at<br> Canterbury. At the council therefore they gave Godwin fairly his<br> earldom, so full and so free as he at first possessed it; and his<br> sons also all that they formerly had; and his wife and his<br> daughter so full and so free as they formerly had. And they<br> fastened full friendship between them, and ordained good laws to<br> all people. Then they outlawed all Frenchmen--who before<br> instituted bad laws, and judged unrighteous judgment, and brought<br> bad counsels into this land--except so many as they concluded<br> it was agreeable to the king to have with him, who were true to<br> him and to all his people. It was with difficulty that Bishop<br> Robert, and Bishop William, and Bishop Ulf, escaped with the<br> Frenchmen that were with them, and so went over sea. Earl<br> Godwin, and Harold, and the queen, sat in their stations. Sweyne<br> had before gone to Jerusalem from Bruges, and died on his way<br> home at Constantinople, at Michaelmas. It was on the Monday<br> after the festival of St. Mary, that Godwin came with his ships<br> to Southwark: and on the morning afterwards, on the Tuesday, they<br> were reconciled as it stands here before recorded. Godwin then<br> sickened soon after he came up, and returned back. But he made<br> altogether too little restitution of God's property, which he<br> acquired from many places. At the same time Arnwy, Abbot of<br> Peterborough, resigned his abbacy in full health; and gave it to<br> the monk Leofric, with the king's leave and that of the monks;<br> and the Abbot Arnwy lived afterwards eight winters.

This year died Alfric, Archbishop of York, a very<br> pious man, and wise. And in the same year King Edward abolished<br> the tribute, which King Ethelred had before imposed: that was in<br> the nine-and-thirtieth year after he had begun it. That tax<br> distressed all the English nation during so long a time, as it<br> has been written; that was ever before other taxes which were<br> variously paid, and wherewith the people were manifestly<br> distressed. In the same year Eustace [Earl of Boulougne] landed<br> at Dover: he had King Edward's sister to wife. Then went his men<br> inconsiderately after quarters, and a certain man of the town<br> they slew; and another man of the town their companion; so that<br> there lay seven of his companions. And much harm was there done<br> on either side, by horse and also by weapons, until the people<br> gathered together: and then they fled away until they came to the<br> king at Gloucester; and he gave them protection. When Godwin,<br> the earl, understood that such things should have happened in his<br> earldom, then began he to gather together people over all his<br> earldom, (75) and Sweyn, the earl, his son, over his, and Harold,<br> his other son, over his earldom; and they all drew together in<br> Gloucestershire, at Langtree, a great force and countless, all<br> ready for battle against the king, unless Eustace were given up,<br> and his men placed in their hands, and also the Frenchmen who<br> were in the castle. This was done seven days before the latter<br> mass of St. Mary. Then was King Edward sitting at Gloucester.<br> Then sent he after Leofric the earl [Of Mercia] and north after<br> Siward the earl [Of Northumbria] and begged their forces. And<br> then they came to him; first with a moderate aid, but after they<br> knew how it was there, in the south, then sent they north over<br> all their earldoms, and caused to be ordered out a large force<br> for the help of their lord; and Ralph, also, over his earldom:<br> and then came they all to Gloucester to help the king, though it<br> might be late. Then were they all so united in opinion with the<br> king that they would have sought out Godwin's forces if the king<br> had so willed. Then thought some of them that it would be a<br> great folly that they should join battle; because there was<br> nearly all that was most noble in England in the two armies, and<br> they thought that they should expose the land to our foes, and<br> cause great destruction among ourselves. Then counselled they<br> that hostages should be given mutually; and they appointed a term<br> at London, and thither the people were ordered out over all this<br> north end, in Siward's earldom, and in Leofric's, and also<br> elsewhere; and Godwin, the earl, and his sons were to come there<br> with their defence. Then came they to Southwark, and a great<br> multitude with them, from Wessex; but his band continually<br> diminished the longer he stayed. And they exacted pledges for<br> the king from all the thanes who were under Harold, the earl, his<br> son; and then they outlawed Sweyn, the earl, his other son. Then<br> did it not suit him to come with a defence to meet the king, and<br> to meet the army which was with him. Then went he by night away;<br> and the king on the morrow held a council, and, together with all<br> the army, declared him an outlaw, him and all his sons. And he<br> went south to Thorney, and his wife, and Sweyn his son, and Tosty<br> and his wife, Baldwin's relation of Bruges, and Grith his son.<br> And Harold, the earl, and Leofwine, went to Bristol in the ship<br> which Sweyn, the earl, had before got ready for himself, and<br> provisioned. And the king sent Bishop Aldred [Of Worcester] to<br> London with a force; and they were to overtake him ere he came on<br> ship-board: but they could not or they would not.

And in this same year, the king decreed,<br> and his council, that ships should proceed to Sandwich; and they<br> set Ralph, the earl, and Odda, the earl [Of Devon], as headmen<br> thereto. Then Godwin, the earl, went out from Bruges with his<br> ships to Ysendyck, and left it one day before Midsummer's-mass<br> eve, so that he came to Ness, which is south of Romney. Then<br> came it to the knowledge of the earls out at Sandwich; and they<br> then went out after the other ships, and a land-force was ordered<br> out against the ships. Then during this, Godwin, the earl, was<br> warned, and then he went to Pevensey; and the weather was very<br> severe, so that the earls could not learn what was become of<br> Godwin, the earl. And then Godwin, the earl, went out again,<br> until he came once more to Bruges; and the other ships returned<br> again to Sandwich.

And then they went<br> westward until they came to Portland, and there they landed,<br> and did whatsoever harm they were able to do. Then was Harold<br> come out from Ireland with nine ships; and then landed at<br> Porlock, and there much people was gathered against him; but he<br> failed not to procure himself provisions. He proceeded further,<br> and slew there a great number of the people, and took of cattle,<br> and of men, and of property as it suited him. He then went<br> eastward to his father; and then they both went eastward until<br> they came to the Isle of Wight, and there took that which was yet<br> remaining for them. And then they went thence to Pevensey and<br> got away thence as many ships as were there fit for service, and<br> so onwards until he came to Ness, and got all the ships which<br> were in Romney, and in Hythe, and in Folkstone. And then they<br> went east to Dover, and there landed, and there took ships and<br> hostages, as many as they would, and so went to Sandwich and did<br> \"hand\" the same; and everywhere hostages were given them, and<br> provisions wherever they desired.

When they came to London, there<br> lay the king and all the earls there against them, with fifty<br> ships. Then the earls sent to the king, and required of him,<br> that they might be held worthy of each of those things which<br> had been unjustly taken from them. Then the king, however,<br> resisted some while; so long as until the people who were with<br> the earl were much stirred against the king and against his<br> people, so that the earl himself with difficulty stilled the<br> people.

Then there was a great<br> council proclaimed without London: and all the earls and the<br> chief men who were in this land were at the council.

Then was it made known to King Harold, who was in<br> London, that Tosty his brother was come to Sandwich. Then<br> gathered he so great a ship-force, and also a land force, as no<br> king here in the land had before gathered, because it had been<br> soothly said unto him, that William the earl from Normandy, King<br> Edward's kinsman, would come hither and subdue this land: all as<br> it afterwards happened. When Tosty learned that King Harold was<br> on his way to Sandwich, then went he from Sandwich, and took some<br> of the boatmen with him, some willingly and some unwillingly; and<br> went then north into Humber, and there ravaged in Lindsey, and<br> there slew many good men. When Edwin the earl and Morcar the<br> earl understood that, then came they thither, and drove him out<br> of the land. And he went then to Scotland: and the king of Scots<br> protected him, and assisted him with provisions; and he there<br> abode all the summer. Then came King Harold to Sandwich, and<br> there awaited his fleet, because it was long before it could be<br> gathered together. And when his fleet was gathered together,<br> then went he into the Isle of Wight, and there lay all the summer<br> and the harvest; and a land-force was kept everywhere by the sea,<br> though in the end it was of no benefit. When it was the Nativity<br> of St. Mary, then were the men's provisions gone, and no man<br> could any longer keep them there. Then were the men allowed to<br> go home, and the king rode up, and the ships were dispatched to<br> London; and many perished before they came thither. When the<br> ships had reached home, then came King Harald from Norway, north<br> into Tyne, and unawares, with a very large ship-force, and no<br> small one; that might be, or more. And Tosty the earl came to<br> him with all that he had gotten, all as they had before agreed;<br> and then they went both, with all the fleet, along the Ouse, up<br> towards York.

Then went he<br> northward, day and night, as quickly as he could gather his<br> forces. Then, before that King Harold could come thither, then<br> gathered Edwin the earl and Morcar the earl from their earldom<br> as great a force as they could get together; and they fought<br> against the army, and made great slaughter: and there was much of<br> the English people slain, and drowned, and driven away in flight;<br> and the Northmen had possession of the place of carnage.

This summer the child Edgar departed,<br> with his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, Margaret and<br> Christina, and Merle-Sweyne, and many good men with them; and<br> came to Scotland under the protection of King Malcolm, who<br> entertained them all. Then began King Malcolm to yearn after the<br> child's sister, Margaret, to wife; but he and all his men long<br> refused; and she also herself was averse, and said that she would<br> neither have him nor any one else, if the Supreme Power would<br> grant, that she in her maidenhood might please the mighty Lord<br> with a carnal heart, in this short life, in pure continence. The<br> king, however, earnestly urged her brother, until he answered<br> Yea. And indeed he durst not otherwise; for they were come into<br> his kingdom. So that then it was fulfilled, as God had long ere<br> foreshowed; and else it could not be; as he himself saith in his<br> gospel: that \"not even a sparrow on the ground may fall, without<br> his foreshowing.\" The prescient Creator wist long before what he<br> of her would have done; for that she should increase the glory of<br> God in this land, lead the king aright from the path of error,<br> bend him and his people together to a better way, and suppress<br> the bad customs which the nation formerly followed: all which she<br> afterwards did. The king therefore received her, though it was<br> against her will, and was pleased with her manners, and thanked<br> God, who in his might had given him such a match. He wisely<br> bethought himself, as he was a prudent man, and turned himself to<br> God, and renounced all impurity; accordingly, as the apostle<br> Paul, the teacher of all the gentries, saith: \"Salvabitur vir<br> infidelis per mulierem fidelem; sic et mulier infidelis per virum<br> fidelem,\" etc.: that is in our language, \"Full oft the<br> unbelieving husband is sanctified and healed through the<br> believing wife, and so belike the wife through the believing<br> husband.\" This queen aforesaid performed afterwards many useful<br> deeds in this land to the glory of God, and also in her royal<br> estate she well conducted herself, as her nature was. Of a<br> faithful and noble kin was she sprung. Her father was Edward<br> Etheling, son of King Edmund.

Soon after this came from Denmark<br> three of the sons of King Sweyne with two hundred and forty<br> ships, together with Earl Esborn and Earl Thurkill, into the<br> Humber; where they were met by the child Edgar, and Earl<br> Waltheof, and Merle-Sweyne, and Earl Gospatric with the<br> Northumbrians, and all the landsmen; riding and marching full<br> merrily with an immense army: and so all unanimously advanced to<br> York; where they stormed and demolished the castle, and won<br> innumerable treasures therein; slew there many hundreds of<br> Frenchmen, and led many with them to the ships; but, ere that the<br> shipmen came thither, the Frenchmen had burned the city, and also<br> the holy minster of St. Peter had they entirely plundered, and<br> destroyed with fire. When the king heard this, then went he<br> northward with all the force that he could collect, despoiling<br> and laying waste the shire withal; whilst the fleet lay all the<br> winter in the Humber, where the king could not come at them. The<br> king was in York on Christmas Day, and so all the winter on land,<br> and came to Winchester at Easter. Bishop Egelric, who was at<br> Peterborough, was this year betrayed, and led to Westminster; and<br> his brother Egelwine was outlawed. This year also died Brand,<br> Abbot of Peterborough, on the fifth before the calends of<br> December.<br>abbot<br>archbishop<br>army<br>betray<br>bishop<br>brother<br>burn<br>bury<br>castle<br>child<br>destroy<br>die<br>dignity<br>earl<br>ere<br>fire<br>fleet<br>hear<br>holy<br>king<br>land<br>landsman<br>lay_waste<br>lie<br>minster<br>outlaw<br>plunder<br>ship<br>slay<br>son<br>storm<br>treasure<br>win", "A.D. 1070. This year Landfranc, who was Abbot of Caen, came to<br> England; and after a few days he became Archbishop of Canterbury.<br> He was invested on the fourth before the calends of September in<br> his own see by eight bishops, his suffragans. The others, who<br> were not there, by messengers and by letter declared why they<br> could not be there. The same year Thomas, who was chosen Bishop<br> of York, came to Canterbury, to be invested there after the<br> ancient custom. But when Landfranc craved confirmation of his<br> obedience with an oath, he refused; and said, that he ought not<br> to do it. Whereupon Archbishop Landfranc was wroth, and bade the<br> bishops, who were come thither by Archbishop Landfranc's command<br> to do the service, and all the monks to unrobe themselves. And<br> they by his order so did. Thomas, therefore, for the time,<br> departed without consecration. Soon after this, it happened that<br> the Archbishop Landfranc went to Rome, and Thomas with him. When<br> they came thither, and had spoken about other things concerning<br> which they wished to speak, then began Thomas his speech: how he<br> came to Canterbury, and how the archbishop required obedience of<br> him with an oath; but he declined it. Then began the Archbishop<br> Landfranc to show with clear distinction, that what he craved he<br> craved by right; and with strong arguments he confirmed the same<br> before the Pope Alexander, and before all the council that was<br> collected there; and so they went home. After this came Thomas<br> to Canterbury; and all that the archbishop required of him he<br> humbly fulfilled, and afterwards received consecration. This<br> year Earl Waltheof agreed with the king; but in the Lent of the<br> same year the king ordered all the monasteries in England to be<br> plundered. In the same year came King Sweyne from Denmark into<br> the Humber; and the landsmen came to meet him, and made a treaty<br> with him; thinking that he would overrun the land. Then came<br> into Ely Christien, the Danish bishop, and Earl Osbern, and the<br> Danish domestics with them; and the English people from all the<br> fen-lands came to them; supposing that they should win all that<br> land. Then the monks of Peterborough heard say, that their own<br> men would plunder the minster; namely Hereward and his gang:<br> because they understood that the king had given the abbacy to a<br> French abbot, whose name was Thorold;--that he was a very stern<br> man, and was then come into Stamford with all his Frenchmen. Now<br> there was a churchwarden, whose name was Yware; who took away by<br> night all that he could, testaments, mass-hackles, cantel-copes,<br> and reefs, and such other small things, whatsoever he could; and<br> went early, before day, to the Abbot Thorold; telling him that he<br> sought his protection, and informing him how the outlaws were<br> coming to Peterborough, and that he did all by advice of the<br> monks. Early in the morning came all the outlaws with many<br> ships, resolving to enter the minster; but the monks withstood,<br> so that they could not come in. Then they laid on fire, and<br> burned all the houses of the monks, and all the town except one<br> house. Then came they in through fire at the Bull-hithe gate;<br> where the monks met them, and besought peace of them. But they<br> regarded nothing. They went into the minster, climbed up to the<br> holy rood, took away the diadem from our Lord's head, all of pure<br> gold, and seized the bracket that was underneath his feet, which<br> was all of red gold. They climbed up to the steeple, brought<br> down the table that was hid there, which was all of gold and<br> silver, seized two golden shrines, and nine of silver, and took<br> away fifteen large crucifixes, of gold and of silver; in short,<br> they seized there so much gold and silver, and so many treasures,<br> in money, in raiment, and in books, as no man could tell another;<br> and said, that they did it from their attachment to the minster.<br> Afterwards they went to their ships, proceeded to Ely, and<br> deposited there all the treasure. The Danes, believing that they<br> should overcome the Frenchmen, drove out all the monks; leaving<br> there only one, whose name was Leofwine Lang, who lay sick in the<br> infirmary. Then came Abbot Thorold and eight times twenty<br> Frenchmen with him, all full-armed. When he came thither, he<br> found all within and without consumed by fire, except the church<br> alone; but the outlaws were all with the fleet, knowing that he<br> would come thither. This was done on the fourth day before the<br> nones of June. The two kings, William and Sweyne, were now<br> reconciled; and the Danes went out of Ely with all the aforesaid<br> treasure, and carried it away with them. But when they came into<br> the middle of the sea, there came a violent storm, and dispersed<br> all the ships wherein the treasures were. Some went to Norway,<br> some to Ireland, some to Denmark. All that reached the latter,<br> consisted of the table, and some shrines, and some crucifixes,<br> and many of the other treasures; which they brought to a king's<br> town, called ----, and deposited it all there in the church.<br> Afterwards through their own carelessness, and through their<br> drunkenness, in one night the church and all that was therein was<br> consumed by fire. Thus was the minster of Peterborough burned<br> and plundered. Almighty God have mercy on it through his great<br> goodness. Thus came the Abbot Thorold to Peterborough; and the<br> monks too returned, and performed the service of Christ in the<br> church, which had before stood a full week without any kind of<br> rite. When Bishop Aylric heard it, he excommunicated all the men<br> who that evil deed had done. There was a great famine this year:<br> and in the summer came the fleet in the north from the Humber<br> into the Thames, and lay there two nights, and made afterwards<br> for Denmark. Earl Baldwin also died, and his son Arnulf<br> succeeded to the earldom. Earl William, in conjunction with the<br> king of the Franks, was to be his guardian; but Earl Robert came<br> and slew his kinsman Arnulf and the earl, put the king to flight,<br> and slew many thousands of his men.<br>abbot<br>abbot_monk<br>advice<br>agree<br>archbishop<br>bishop<br>burn<br>choose<br>church<br>collect<br>come_meet<br>command<br>concern<br>confirm<br>consecration<br>council<br>declare<br>deed<br>depart<br>die<br>disperse<br>drive<br>earl<br>evil<br>fen<br>fire<br>fleet<br>gate<br>give_abbacy<br>gold_silver<br>great_famine<br>hear<br>hide<br>holy<br>invest<br>king<br>kinsman<br>land<br>landsman<br>leave<br>lie<br>lord<br>mass<br>messenger<br>minster<br>monastery<br>money<br>monk<br>oath<br>outlaw<br>overcome<br>peace<br>perform<br>plunder<br>pope<br>proceed<br>reach<br>receive<br>reconcile<br>refuse<br>return<br>rood<br>sea<br>seize<br>service<br>ship<br>sick<br>slew<br>son_succeed<br>speak<br>storm<br>treasure<br>treaty<br>win_land", "A.D. 1071.

This year King William went over sea to Normandy; and<br> child Edgar came from Flanders into Scotland on St. Grimbald's<br> mass-day; where King Malcolm and his sister Margaret received him<br> with much pomp. At the same time sent Philip, the King of<br> France, a letter to him, bidding him to come to him, and he would<br> give him the castle of Montreuil; that he might afterwards daily<br> annoy his enemies. What then? King Malcolm and his sister<br> Margaret gave him and his men great presents, and many treasures;<br> in skins ornamented with purple, in pelisses made of martin-skins,<br> of grey-skins, and of ermine-skins, in palls, and in<br> vessels of gold and silver; and conducted him and his crew with<br> great pomp from his territory.

Their treasure<br> was nearly all lost, and some of his men also were taken by the<br> French; but he himself and his best men returned again to<br> Scotland, some roughly travelling on foot, and some miserably<br> mounted. Then King Malcolm advised him to send to King William<br> over sea, to request his friendship, which he did; and the king<br> gave it him, and sent after him. Again, therefore, King Malcolm<br> and his sister gave him and all his men numberless treasures, and<br> again conducted him very magnificently from their territory.

This same Ralph was British on<br> his mother's side; but his father, whose name was also Ralph, was<br> English; and born in Norfolk.

It was Earl Roger and Earl Ralph who were the<br> authors of that plot; and who enticed the Britons to them, and<br> sent eastward to Denmark after a fleet to assist them. Roger<br> went westward to his earldom, and collected his people there, to<br> the king's annoyance, as he thought; but it was to the great<br> disadvantage of himself. He was however prevented. Ralph also<br> in his earldom would go forth with his people; but the castlemen<br> that were in England and also the people of the land, came<br> against him, and prevented him from doing anything. He escaped<br> however to the ships at Norwich. (97) And his wife was in the<br> castle; which she held until peace was made with her; when she<br> went out of England, with all her men who wished to join her.<br> The king afterwards came to England, and seized Earl Roger, his<br> relative, and put him in prison.

This year arose the tumult at Glastonbury betwixt the<br> Abbot Thurstan and his monks. It proceeded first from the<br> abbot's want of wisdom, that he misgoverned his monks in many<br> things. But the monks meant well to him; and told him that he<br> should govern them rightly, and love them, and they would be<br> faithful and obedient to him. The abbot, however, would hear<br> nothing of this; but evil entreated them, and threatened them<br> worse. One day the abbot went into the chapter-house, and spoke<br> against the monks, and attempted to mislead them; (101) and sent<br> after some laymen, and they came full-armed into the chapter-house<br> upon the monks. Then were the monks very much afraid (102)<br> of them, and wist not what they were to do, but they shot<br> forward, and some ran into the church, and locked the doors after<br> them.

But the king left the army to shift for themselves<br> through all this land amongst his subjects, who fed them, each<br> according to his quota of land. Men suffered much distress this<br> year; and the king caused the land to be laid waste about the sea<br> coast; that, if his foes came up, they might not have anything on<br> which they could very readily seize.

After this had<br> the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his<br> council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort<br> of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire;<br> commissioning them to find out \"How many hundreds of hides were<br> in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon<br> the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the<br> shire.\" Also he commissioned them to record in writing, \"How<br> much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his<br> abbots, and his earls;\" and though I may be prolix and tedious,<br> \"What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in<br> England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were<br> worth.\" So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to<br> trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard<br> (108) of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he<br> thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a<br> swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ.

Afterwards he moved about so that he came by<br> Lammas to Sarum; where he was met by his councillors; and all the<br> landsmen that were of any account over all England became this<br> man's vassals as they were; and they all bowed themselves before<br> him, and became his men, and swore him oaths of allegiance that<br> they would against all other men be faithful to him. Thence he<br> proceeded into the Isle of Wight; because he wished to go into<br> Normandy, and so he afterwards did; though he first did according<br> to his custom; he collected a very large sum from his people,<br> wherever he could make any demand, whether with justice or<br> otherwise. Then he went into Normandy; and Edgar Etheling, the<br> relation of King Edward, revolted from him, for he received not<br> much honour from him; but may the Almighty God give him honour<br> hereafter.

And the<br> same year there was a very heavy season, and a swinkful and<br> sorrowful year in England, in murrain of cattle, and corn and<br> fruits were at a stand, and so much untowardness in the weather,<br> as a man may not easily think; so tremendous was the thunder and<br> lightning, that it killed many men; and it continually grew worse<br> and worse with men.

In this year was this land much stirred, and filled<br> with great treachery; so that the richest Frenchmen that were in<br> this land would betray their lord the king, and would have his<br> brother Robert king, who was earl in Normandy. In this design<br> was engaged first Bishop Odo, and Bishop Gosfrith, and William,<br> Bishop of Durham. So well did the king by the bishop [Odo] that<br> all England fared according to his counsel, and as he would. And<br> the bishop thought to do by him as Judas Iscariot did by our<br> Lord. And Earl Roger was also of this faction; and much people<br> was with him all Frenchmen. This conspiracy was formed in Lent.<br> As soon as Easter came, then went they forth, and harrowed, and<br> burned, and wasted the king's farms; and they despoiled the lands<br> of all the men that were in the king's service. And they each of<br> them went to his castle, and manned it, and provisioned it as<br> well as they could. Bishop Gosfrith, and Robert the peace-breaker,<br> went to Bristol, and plundered it, and brought the spoil<br> to the castle. Afterwards they went out of the castle, and<br> plundered Bath, and all the land thereabout; and all the honor<br> (112) of Berkeley they laid waste. And the men that eldest were<br> of Hereford, and all the shire forthwith, and the men of<br> Shropshire, with much people of Wales, came and plundered and<br> burned in Worcestershire, until they came to the city itself,<br> which it was their design to set on fire, and then to rifle the<br> minster, and win the king's castle to their hands. The worthy<br> Bishop Wulfstan, seeing these things, was much agitated in his<br> mind, because to him was betaken the custody of the castle.<br> Nevertheless his hired men went out of the castle with few<br> attendants, and, through God's mercy and the bishop's merits,<br> slew or took five hundred men, and put all the others to flight.<br> The Bishop of Durham did all the harm that he could over all by<br> the north. Roger was the name of one of them; (113) who leaped<br> into the castle at Norwich, and did yet the worst of all over all<br> that land. Hugh also was one, who did nothing better either in<br> Leicestershire or in Northamptonshire. The Bishop Odo being one,<br> though of the same family from which the king himself was<br> descended, went into Kent to his earldom, and greatly despoiled<br> it; and having laid waste the lands of the king and of the<br> archbishop withal, he brought the booty into his castle at<br> Rochester. When the king understood all these things, and what<br> treachery they were employing against him, then was he in his<br> mind much agitated. He then sent after Englishmen, described to<br> them his need, earnestly requested their support, and promised<br> them the best laws that ever before were in this land; each<br> unright guild he forbade, and restored to the men their woods and<br> chaces. But it stood no while. The Englishmen however went to<br> the assistance of the king their lord. They advanced toward<br> Rochester, with a view to get possession of the Bishop Odo; for<br> they thought, if they had him who was at first the head of the<br> conspiracy, they might the better get possession of all the<br> others. They came then to the castle at Tunbridge; and there<br> were in the castle the knights of Bishop Odo, and many others who<br> were resolved to hold it against the king. But the Englishmen<br> advanced, and broke into the castle, and the men that were<br> therein agreed with the king. The king with his army went toward<br> Rochester. And they supposed that the bishop was therein; but it<br> was made known to the king that the bishop was gone to the castle<br> at Pevensea. And the king with his army went after, and beset<br> the castle about with a very large force full six weeks. During<br> this time the Earl of Normandy, Robert, the king's brother,<br> gathered a very considerable force, and thought to win England<br> with the support of those men that were in this land against the<br> king. And he sent some of his men to this land, intending to<br> come himself after. But the Englishmen that guarded the sea<br> lighted upon some of the men, and slew them, and drowned more<br> than any man could tell. When provisions afterwards failed those<br> within the castle, they earnestly besought peace, and gave<br> themselves up to the king; and the bishop swore that he would<br> depart out of England, and no more come on this land, unless the<br> king sent after him, and that he would give up the castle at<br> Rochester. Just as the bishop was going with an intention to<br> give up the castle, and the king had sent his men with him, then<br> arose the men that were in the castle, and took the bishop and<br> the king's men, and put them into prison. In the castle were<br> some very good knights; Eustace the Young, and the three sons of<br> Earl Roger, and all the best born men that were in this land or<br> in Normandy. When the king understood this thing, then went he<br> after with the army that he had there, and sent over all England.<br> and bade that each man that was faithful should come to him,<br> French and English, from sea-port and from upland. Then came to<br> him much people; and he went to Rochester, and beset the castle,<br> until they that were therein agreed, and gave up the castle. The<br> Bishop Odo with the men that were in the castle went over sea,<br> and the bishop thus abandoned the dignity that he had in this<br> land. The king afterwards sent an army to Durham, and allowed it<br> to beset the castle, and the bishop agreed, and gave up the<br> castle, and relinquished his bishopric, and went to Normandy.<br> Many Frenchmen also abandoned their lands, and went over sea; and<br> the king gave their lands to the men that were faithful to him.<br>abandon<br>agree<br>allow<br>archbishop<br>arise<br>army<br>assistance<br>betray<br>bishop<br>bishopric<br>booty<br>brother<br>burn<br>castle<br>conspiracy<br>counsel<br>custody<br>depart<br>design<br>dignity<br>do_harm<br>earl<br>engage<br>faithful<br>fill<br>fire<br>give_castle<br>go_sea<br>guild<br>king<br>knight<br>land<br>lay_waste<br>lord<br>minster<br>peace<br>plunder<br>plunder_burn<br>port<br>possession<br>promise<br>provision<br>put_flight<br>restore<br>sea<br>service<br>slew<br>son<br>spoil<br>swear<br>treachery<br>waste<br>win<br>wood", "A.D. 1089. In this year the venerable father and favourer of<br> monks, Archbishop Landfranc, departed this life; but we hope that<br> he is gone to the heavenly kingdom.

Indiction XIII. These things thus done, just as we<br> have already said above, by the king, and by his brother and by<br> this men, the king was considering how he might wreak his<br> vengeance on his brother Robert, harass him most, and win<br> Normandy of him. And indeed through his craft, or through<br> bribery, he got possession of the castle at St. Valeri, and the<br> haven; and so he got possession of that at Albemarle. And<br> therein he set his knights; and they did harm to the land in<br> harrowing and burning. After this he got possession of more<br> castles in the land; and therein lodged his horsemen. When the<br> Earl of Normandy, Robert, understood that his sworn men deceived<br> him, and gave up their castles to do him harm, then sent he to<br> his lord, Philip, king of the Franks; and he came to Normandy<br> with a large army, and the king and the earl with an immense<br> force beset the castle about, wherein were the men of the King of<br> England. But the King William of England sent to Philip, king of<br> the Franks; and he for his love, or for his great treasure,<br> abandoned thus his subject the Earl Robert and his land; and<br> returned again to France, and let them so remain.

In this year the King William held his court at<br> Christmas in Westminster, and thereafter at Candlemas he went,<br> for the annoyance of his brother, out of England into Normandy.<br> Whilst he was there, their reconciliation took place, on the<br> condition, that the earl put into his hands Feschamp, and the<br> earldom of Ou, and Cherbourg; and in addition to this, that the<br> king's men should be secure in the castles that they had won<br> against the will of the earl. And the king in return promised<br> him those many [castles] that their father had formerly won, and<br> also to reduce those that had revolted from the earl, also all<br> that his father had there beyond, except those that he had then<br> given the king, and that all those, that in England before for<br> the earl had lost their land, should have it again by this<br> treaty, and that the earl should have in England just so much as<br> was specified in this agreement. And if the earl died without a<br> son by lawful wedlock, the king should be heir of all Normandy;<br> and by virtue of this same treaty, if the king died, the earl<br> should be heir of all England. To this treaty swore twelve of<br> the best men of the king's side, and twelve of the earl's, though<br> it stood but a little while afterwards. In the midst of this<br> treaty was Edgar Etheling deprived of the land that the earl had<br> before permitted him to keep in hand; and he went out of Normandy<br> to the king, his sister's husband, in Scotland, and to his<br> sister. Whilst the King William was out of England, the King<br> Malcolm of Scotland came hither into England, and overran a great<br> deal of it, until the good men that governed this land sent an<br> army against him and repulsed him. When the King William in<br> Normandy heard this, then prepared he his departure, and came to<br> England, and his brother, the Earl Robert, with him; and he soon<br> issued an order to collect a force both naval and military; but<br> the naval force, ere it could come to Scotland, perished almost<br> miserably, a few days before St. Michael's mass. And the king<br> and his brother proceeded with the land-force; but when the King<br> Malcolm heard that they were resolved to seek him with an army,<br> he went with his force out of Scotland into Lothaine in England,<br> and there abode. When the King William came near with his army,<br> then interceded between them Earl Robert, and Edgar Etheling, and<br> so made the peace of the kings, that the King Malcolm came to our<br> king, and did homage, (114) promising all such obedience as he<br> formerly paid to his father; and that he confirmed with an oath.<br> And the King William promised him in land and in all things<br> whatever he formerly had under his father. In this settlement<br> was also Edgar Etheling united with the king. And the kings then<br> with much satisfaction departed; yet that stood but a little<br> while. And the Earl Robert tarried here full nigh until<br> Christmas with the king, and during this time found but little of<br> the truth of their agreement; and two days before that tide he<br> took ship in the Isle of Wight, and went into Normandy, and Edgar<br> Etheling with him.<br>abode<br>army<br>brother<br>castle<br>collect<br>deal<br>depart<br>deprive<br>die<br>do_homage<br>earl<br>ere<br>ethel<br>father<br>force<br>good_man<br>govern<br>hear<br>heir<br>hold_court<br>king<br>land<br>land_force<br>lose<br>make_peace<br>mass<br>naval<br>naval_force<br>overrun<br>pay<br>perish<br>proceed<br>promise<br>reduce<br>return<br>secure<br>seek<br>ship<br>sister<br>son<br>swear<br>treaty<br>unite<br>win", "A.D. 1092. In this year the King William with a large army went<br> north to Carlisle, and restored the town, and reared the castle,<br> and drove out Dolphin that before governed the land, and set his<br> own men in the castle, and then returned hither southward.

In this year, during Lent, was the King William at<br> Glocester so sick, that he was by all reported dead. And in his<br> illness he made many good promises to lead his own life aright;<br> to grant peace and protection to the churches of God, and never<br> more again with fee to sell; to have none but righteous laws<br> amongst his people. The archbishopric of Canterbury, that before<br> remained in his own hand, he transferred to Anselm, who was<br> before Abbot of Bec; to Robert his chancellor the bishopric of<br> Lincoln; and to many minsters he gave land; but that he<br> afterwards took away, when he was better, and annulled all the<br> good laws that he promised us before. Then after this sent the<br> King of Scotland, and demanded the fulfilment of the treaty that<br> was promised him. And the King William cited him to Glocester,<br> and sent him hostages to Scotland; and Edgar Etheling,<br> afterwards, and the men returned, that brought him with great<br> dignity to the king. But when he came to the king, he could not<br> be considered worthy either of our king's speech, or of the<br> conditions that were formerly promised him. For this reason<br> therefore they parted with great dissatisfaction, and the King<br> Malcolm returned to Scotland. And soon after he came home, he<br> gathered his army, and came harrowing into England with more<br> hostility than behoved him; and Robert, the Earl of<br> Northumberland, surrounded him unawares with his men, and slew<br> him. Morel of Barnborough slew him, who was the earl's steward,<br> and a baptismal friend (115) of King Malcolm. With him was also<br> slain Edward his son; who after him should have been king, if he<br> had lived. When the good Queen Margaret heard this--her most<br> beloved lord and son thus betrayed she was in her mind almost<br> distracted to death. She with her priests went to church, and<br> performed her rites, and prayed before God, that she might give<br> up the ghost. And the Scots then chose (116) Dufenal to king,<br> Malcolm's brother, and drove out all the English that formerly<br> were with the King Malcolm. When Duncan, King Malcolm's son,<br> heard all that had thus taken place (he was then in the King<br> William's court, because his father had given him as a hostage to<br> our king's father, and so he lived here afterwards), he came to<br> the king, and did such fealty as the king required at his hands;<br> and so with his permission went to Scotland, with all the support<br> that he could get of English and French, and deprived his uncle<br> Dufenal of the kingdom, and was received as king. But the Scots<br> afterwards gathered some force together, and slew full nigh all<br> his men; and he himself with a few made his escape.

This year the King William held his court at<br> Christmas in Glocester; and messengers came to him thither from<br> his brother Robert of Normandy; who said that his brother<br> renounced all peace and conditions, unless the king would fulfil<br> all that they had stipulated in the treaty; and upon that he<br> called him forsworn and void of truth, unless he adhered to the<br> treaty, or went thither and explained himself there, where the<br> treaty was formerly made and also sworn. Then went the king to<br> Hastings at Candlemas; and whilst he there abode waiting the<br> weather, he let hallow the minster at Battel, and deprived<br> Herbert Losang, the Bishop of Thetford, of his staff; and<br> thereafter about mid-Lent went over sea into Normandy. After he<br> came, thither, he and his brother Robert, the earl, said that<br> they should come together in peace (and so they did), and might<br> be united. Afterwards they came together with the same men that<br> before made the treaty, and also confirmed it by oaths; and all<br> the blame of breaking the treaty they threw upon the king; but he<br> would not confess this, nor even adhere to the treaty; and for<br> this reason they parted with much dissatisfaction. And the king<br> afterwards won the castle at Bures, and took the earl's men<br> therein; some of whom he sent hither to this land. On the other<br> hand the earl, with the assistance of the King of France, won the<br> castle at Argence, and took therein Roger of Poitou, (118) and<br> seven hundred of the king's knights with him; and afterwards that<br> at Hulme; and oft readily did either of them burn the towns of<br> the other, and also took men. Then sent the king hither to this<br> land, and ordered twenty thousand Englishmen to be sent out to<br> Normandy to his assistance; but when they came to sea, they then<br> had orders to return, and to pay to the king's behoof the fee<br> that they had taken; which was half a pound each man; and they<br> did so. And the earl after this, with the King of France, and<br> with all that he could gather together, went through the midst of<br> Normandy, towards Ou, where the King William was, and thought to<br> besiege him within; and so they advanced until they came to<br> Luneville. There was the King of France through cunning turned<br> aside; and so afterwards all the army dispersed. In the midst of<br> these things the King William sent after his brother Henry, who<br> was in the castle at Damfront; but because he could not go<br> through Normandy with security, he sent ships after him, and<br> Hugh, Earl of Chester. When, however, they should have gone<br> towards Ou where the king was, they went to England, and came up<br> at Hamton, (119) on the eve of the feast of All Saints, and here<br> afterwards abode; and at Christmas they were in London. In this<br> same year also the Welshmen gathered themselves together, and<br> with the French that were in Wales, or in the neighbourhood, and<br> had formerly seized their land, stirred up war, and broke into<br> many fastnesses and castles, and slew many men. And when their<br> followers had increased, they divided themselves into larger<br> parties. With some part of them fought Hugh, Earl of Shropshire,<br> (120) and put them to flight. Nevertheless the other part of<br> them all this year omitted no evil that they could do. This year<br> also the Scots ensnared their king, Duncan, and slew him; and<br> afterwards, the second time, took his uncle Dufenal to king,<br> through whose instruction and advice he was betrayed to death.<br>abode<br>advice<br>army<br>assistance<br>besiege<br>betray<br>bishop<br>brother<br>burn_town<br>call<br>castle<br>death<br>deprive<br>disperse<br>divide<br>earl<br>evil<br>fight<br>gather<br>go_sea<br>hallow<br>hold_court<br>increase<br>king<br>knight<br>land<br>messenger<br>minster<br>pay<br>peace<br>put_flight<br>renounce<br>return<br>sea<br>security<br>seize<br>ship<br>slay<br>slew<br>swear<br>throw<br>treaty<br>uncle<br>unite<br>war<br>weather", "A.D. 1095. In this year was the King William the first four days<br> of Christmas at Whitsand, and after the fourth day came hither,<br> and landed at Dover. And Henry, the king's brother, abode in<br> this land until Lent, and then went over sea to Normandy, with<br> much treasure, on the king's behalf, against their brother, Earl<br> Robert, and frequently fought against the earl, and did him much<br> harm, both in land and in men. And then at Easter held the king<br> his court in Winchester; and the Earl Robert of Northumberland<br> would not come to court. And the king was much stirred to anger<br> with him for this, and sent to him, and bade him harshly, if he<br> would be worthy of protection, that he would come to court at<br> Pentecost. In this year was Easter on the eighth day before the<br> calends of April; and upon Easter, on the night of the feast of<br> St Ambrose, that is, the second before the nones of April, (121)<br> nearly over all this land, and almost all the night, numerous and<br> manifold stars were seen to fall from heaven; not by one or two,<br> but so thick in succession, that no man could tell it. Hereafter<br> at Pentecost was the king at Windsor, and all his council with<br> him, except the Earl of Northumberland; for the king would<br> neither give him hostages, nor own upon truth, that he might come<br> and go with security. And the king therefore ordered his army,<br> and went against the earl to Northumberland; and soon after he<br> came thither, he won many and nearly all the best of the earl's<br> clan in a fortress, and put them into custody; and the castle at<br> Tinemouth he beset until he won it, and the earl's brother<br> therein, and all that were with him; and afterwards went to<br> Bamborough, and beset the earl therein. But when the king saw<br> that he could not win it, then ordered he his men to make a<br> castle before Bamborough, and called it in his speech<br> \"Malveisin\"; that is in English, \"Evil Neighbour\". And he<br> fortified it strongly with his men, and afterwards went<br> southward. Then, soon after that the king was gone south, went<br> the earl one night out of Bamborough towards Tinemouth; but they<br> that were in the new castle were aware of him, and went after<br> him, and fought him, and wounded him, and afterwards took him.<br> And of those that were with him some they slew, and some they<br> took alive. Among these things it was made known to the king,<br> that the Welshmen in Wales had broken into a castle called<br> Montgomery, and slain the men of Earl Hugo, that should have held<br> it. He therefore gave orders to levy another force immediately,<br> and after Michaelmas went into Wales, and shifted his forces, and<br> went through all that land, so that the army came all together by<br> All Saints to Snowdon. But the Welsh always went before into the<br> mountains and the moors, that no man could come to them. The<br> king then went homeward; for he saw that he could do no more<br> there this winter. When the king came home again, he gave orders<br> to take the Earl Robert of Northumberland, and lead him to<br> Bamborough, and put out both his eyes, unless they that were<br> therein would give up the castle. His wife held it, and Morel<br> who was steward, and also his relative. Through this was the<br> castle then given up; and Morel was then in the king's court; and<br> through him were many both of the clergy and laity surrendered,<br> who with their counsels had conspired against the king. The king<br> had before this time commanded some to be brought into prison,<br> and afterwards had it very strictly proclaimed over all this<br> country, \"That all who held land of the king, as they wished to<br> be considered worthy of protection, should come to court at the<br> time appointed.\" And the king commanded that the Earl Robert<br> should be led to Windsor, and there held in the castle. Also in<br> this same year, against Easter, came the pope's nuncio hither to<br> this land. This was Bishop Walter, a man of very good life, of<br> the town of Albano; and upon the day of Pentecost on the behalf<br> of Pope Urban he gave Archbishop Anselm his pall, and he received<br> him at his archiepiscopal stall in Canterbury. And Bishop Walter<br> remained afterwards in this land a great part of the year; and<br> men then sent by him the Rome-scot, (122) which they had not done<br> for many years before.

In this year held the King William his court at<br> Christmas in Windsor; and William Bishop of Durham died there on<br> new-year's day; and on the octave of the Epiphany was the king<br> and all his councillors at Salisbury. There Geoffry Bainard<br> challenged William of Ou, the king's relative, maintaining that<br> he had been in the conspiracy against the king. And he fought<br> with him, and overcame him in single combat; and after he was<br> overcome, the king gave orders to put out his eyes, and<br> afterwards to emasculate him; and his steward, William by name,<br> who was the son of his stepmother, the king commanded to be<br> hanged on a gibbet. Then was also Eoda, Earl of Champagne, the<br> king's son-in-law, and many others, deprived of their lands;<br> whilst some were led to London, and there killed. This year<br> also, at Easter, there was a very great stir through all this<br> nation and many others, on account of Urban, who was declared<br> Pope, though he had nothing of a see at Rome. And an immense<br> multitude went forth with their wives and children, that they<br> might make war upon the heathens. Through this expedition were<br> the king and his brother, Earl Robert, reconciled; so that the<br> king went over sea, and purchased all Normandy of him, on<br> condition that they should be united. And the earl afterwards<br> departed; and with him the Earl of Flanders, and the Earl of<br> Boulogne, and also many other men of rank (123). And the Earl<br> Robert, and they that went with him, passed the winter in Apulia;<br> but of the people that went by Hungary many thousands miserably<br> perished there and by the way. And many dragged themselves home<br> rueful and hunger-bitten on the approach of winter. This was a<br> very heavy-timed year through all England, both through the<br> manifold tributes, and also through the very heavy-timed hunger<br> that severely oppressed this earth in the course of the year. In<br> this year also the principal men who held this land, frequently<br> sent forces into Wales, and many men thereby grievously<br> afflicted, producing no results but destruction of men and waste<br> of money.<br>account<br>bishop<br>brother<br>child<br>command<br>conspiracy<br>court<br>declare<br>depart<br>deprive<br>destruction<br>die<br>drag<br>earl<br>earth<br>expedition<br>fight<br>force<br>go_sea<br>heathen<br>hunger<br>kill<br>king<br>land<br>law<br>maintain<br>manifold<br>money<br>nation<br>oppress<br>overcome<br>pass<br>perish<br>pope<br>rank<br>reconcile<br>relative<br>son<br>tribute<br>unite<br>war<br>waste<br>wife", "A.D. 1097. In this year was the King William at Christmas in<br> Normandy; and afterwards against Easter he embarked for this<br> land; for that he thought to hold his court at Winchester; but he<br> was weather-bound until Easter-eve, when he first landed at<br> Arundel; and for this reason held his court at Windsor. And<br> thereafter with a great army he went into Wales, and quickly<br> penetrated that land with his forces, through some of the Welsh<br> who were come to him, and were his guides; and he remained in<br> that country from midsummer nearly until August, and suffered<br> much loss there in men and in horses, and also in many other<br> things. The Welshmen, after they had revolted from the king,<br> chose them many elders from themselves; one of whom was called<br> Cadwgan, (124) who was the worthiest of them, being brother's son<br> to King Griffin. And when the king saw that he could do nothing<br> in furtherance of his will, he returned again into this land; and<br> soon after that he let his men build castles on the borders.<br> Then upon the feast of St. Michael, the fourth day before the<br> nones of October, (125) appeared an uncommon star, shining in the<br> evening, and soon hastening to set. It (126) was seen south-west,<br> and the ray that stood off from it was thought very long, shining<br> south-east. And it appeared on this wise nearly all the week.<br> Many men supposed that it was a comet. Soon after this<br> Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury obtained leave (127) of the king<br> (though it was contrary to the wishes of the king, as men<br> supposed), and went over sea; because he thought that men in this<br> country did little according to right and after his instruction.<br> And the king thereafter upon St. Martin's mass went over sea into<br> Normandy; but whilst he was waiting for fair weather, his court<br> in the county where they lay, did the most harm that ever court<br> or army could do in a friendly and peaceable land. This was in<br> all things a very heavy-timed year, and beyond measure laborious<br> from badness of weather, both when men attempted to till the<br> land, and afterwards to gather the fruits of their tilth; and<br> from unjust contributions they never rested. Many counties also<br> that were confined to London by work, were grievously oppressed<br> on account of the wall that they were building about the tower,<br> and the bridge that was nearly all afloat, and the work of the<br> king's hall that they were building at Westminster; and many men<br> perished thereby. Also in this same year soon after Michaelmas<br> went Edgar Etheling with an army through the king's assistance<br> into Scotland, and with hard fighting won that land, and drove<br> out the King Dufnal; and his nephew Edgar, who was son of King<br> Malcolm and of Margaret the queen, he there appointed king in<br> fealty to the King William; and afterwards again returned to<br> England.<br>account<br>appoint<br>archbishop<br>army<br>assistance<br>bridge<br>brother<br>build<br>call<br>castle<br>choose<br>country<br>court<br>do_harm<br>drive<br>ethel<br>fair<br>fruit<br>gather<br>go_sea<br>hold_court<br>horse<br>king<br>land<br>land_force<br>leave<br>lie<br>loss<br>mass<br>nephew<br>obtain<br>oppress<br>perish<br>remain<br>rest<br>return<br>son<br>star<br>suffer<br>unjust<br>wall<br>weather<br>win_land<br>wise<br>work", "A.D. 1098.

In the summer<br> of this year also, at Finchamstead in Berkshire, a pool welled<br> with blood, as many true men said that should see it. And Earl<br> Hugh was slain in Anglesey by foreign pirates, (129) and his<br> brother Robert was his heir, as he had settled it before with the<br> king.

In this year the King William held his court at<br> Christmas in Glocester, and at Easter in Winchester, and at<br> Pentecost in Westminster. And at Pentecost was seen in Berkshire<br> at a certain town blood to well from the earth; as many said that<br> should see it. And thereafter on the morning after Lammas day<br> was the King William shot in hunting, by an arrow from his own<br> men, and afterwards brought to Winchester, and buried in the<br> cathedral. (130) This was in the thirteenth year after that he<br> assumed the government. He was very harsh and severe over his<br> land and his men, and with all his neighbours; and very<br> formidable; and through the counsels of evil men, that to him<br> were always agreeable, and through his own avarice, he was ever<br> tiring this nation with an army, and with unjust contributions.<br> For in his days all right fell to the ground, and every wrong<br> rose up before God and before the world. God's church he<br> humbled; and all the bishoprics and abbacies, whose elders fell<br> in his days, he either sold in fee, or held in his own hands, and<br> let for a certain sum; because he would be the heir of every man,<br> both of the clergy and laity; so that on the day that he fell he<br> had in his own hand the archbishopric of Canterbury, with the<br> bishopric of Winchester, and that of Salisbury, and eleven<br> abbacies, all let for a sum; and (though I may be tedious) all<br> that was loathsome to God and righteous men, all that was<br> customary in this land in his time. And for this he was loathed<br> by nearly all his people, and odious to God, as his end<br> testified:--for he departed in the midst of his<br> unrighteousness, without any power of repentance or recompense<br> for his deeds. On the Thursday he was slain; and in the morning<br> afterwards buried; and after he was buried, the statesmen that<br> were then nigh at hand, chose his brother Henry to king. And he<br> immediately (131) gave the bishopric of Winchester to William<br> Giffard; and afterwards went to London; and on the Sunday<br> following, before the altar at Westminster, he promised God and<br> all the people, to annul all the unrighteous acts that took place<br> in his brother's time, and to maintain the best laws that were<br> valid in any king's day before him. And after this the Bishop of<br> London, Maurice, consecrated him king; and all in this land<br> submitted to him, and swore oaths, and became his men. And the<br> king, soon after this, by the advice of those that were about<br> him, allowed men to take the Bishop Ranulf of Durham, and bring<br> him into the Tower of London, and hold him there. Then, before<br> Michaelmas, came the Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury hither to<br> this land; as the King Henry, by the advice of his ministers had<br> sent after him, because he had gone out of this land for the<br> great wrongs that the King William did unto him. And soon<br> hereafter the king took him to wife Maud, daughter of Malcolm,<br> King of Scotland, and of Margaret the good queen, the relative of<br> King Edward, and of the right royal (132) race of England. And<br> on Martinmas day she was publicly given to him with much pomp at<br> Westminster, and the Archbishop Anselm wedded her to him, and<br> afterwards consecrated her queen. And the Archbishop Thomas of<br> York soon hereafter died. During the harvest of this same year<br> also came the Earl Robert home into Normandy, and the Earl Robert<br> of Flanders, Eustace, Earl of Boulogne, from Jerusalem. And as<br> soon as the Earl Robert came into Normandy, he was joyfully<br> received by all his people; except those of the castles that were<br> garrisoned with the King Henry's men.

In this year at Christmas held the King Henry his<br> court in Westminster, and at Easter in Winchester. And soon<br> thereafter were the chief men in this land in a conspiracy<br> against the king; partly from their own great infidelity, and<br> also through the Earl Robert of Normandy, who with hostility<br> aspired to the invasion of this land. And the king afterwards<br> sent ships out to sea, to thwart and impede his brother; but some<br> of them in the time of need fell back, and turned from the king,<br> and surrendered themselves to the Earl Robert. Then at midsummer<br> went the king out to Pevensey with all his force against his<br> brother, and there awaited him. But in the meantime came the<br> Earl Robert up at Portsmouth twelve nights before Lammas; and the<br> king with all his force came against him. But the chief men<br> interceded between them, and settled the brothers on the<br> condition, \"that the king should forego all that he held by main<br> strength in Normandy against the earl; and that all then in<br> England should have their lands again, who had lost it before<br> through the earl, and Earl Eustace also all his patrimony in this<br> land; and that the Earl Robert every year should receive from<br> England three thousand marks of silver; and particularly, that<br> whichever of the brothers should survive the other, he should be<br> heir of all England and also of Normandy, except the deceased<br> left an heir by lawful wedlock.\" And this twelve men of the<br> highest rank on either side then confirmed with an oath. And the<br> earl afterwards remained in this land till after Michaelmas; and<br> his men did much harm wherever they went, the while that the earl<br> continued in this land. This year also the Bishop Ranulf at<br> Candlemas burst out of the Tower of London by night, where he was<br> in confinement, and went into Normandy; through whose contrivance<br> and instigation mostly the Earl Robert this year sought this land<br> with hostility.<br>bishop<br>brother<br>chief_man<br>conspiracy<br>court<br>do_harm<br>earl<br>fall<br>force<br>heir<br>hostility<br>king<br>land<br>leave<br>lose<br>mark<br>rank<br>receive<br>remain<br>sea<br>seek_land<br>settle<br>ship<br>strength<br>surrender", "A.D. 1102. In this year at the Nativity was the King Henry at<br> Westminster, and at Easter in Winchester. And soon thereafter<br> arose a dissention between the king and the Earl Robert of<br> Belesme, who held in this land the earldom of Shrewsbury, that<br> his father, Earl Roger, had before, and much territory therewith<br> both on this side and beyond the sea. And the king went and<br> beset the castle at Arundel; but when he could not easily win it,<br> he allowed men to make castles before it, and filled them with<br> his men; and afterwards with all his army he went to Bridgenorth,<br> and there continued until he had the castle, and deprived the<br> Earl Robert of his land, and stripped him of all that he had in<br> England. And the earl accordingly went over sea, and the army<br> afterwards returned home. Then was the king thereafter by<br> Michaelmas at Westminster; and all the principal men in this<br> land, clerk, and laity. And the Archbishop Anselm held a synod<br> of clergy; and there they established many canons that belong to<br> Christianity. And many, both French and English, were there<br> deprived of their staves and dignity, which they either obtained<br> with injustice, or enjoyed with dishonour. And in this same<br> year, in the week of the feast of Pentecost, there came thieves,<br> some from Auvergne, (133) some from France, and some from<br> Flanders, and broke into the minster of Peterborough, and therein<br> seized much property in gold and in silver; namely, roods, and<br> chalices, and candlesticks.<br>allow<br>archbishop<br>arise<br>army<br>castle<br>clerk<br>deprive<br>dignity<br>earl<br>earldom_father<br>establish<br>fill<br>go_sea<br>gold_silver<br>king<br>land<br>minster<br>obtain<br>property<br>return<br>rood<br>sea<br>seize<br>synod<br>territory<br>win", "A.D. 1103.

Afterwards<br> were reconciled the Earl Robert of Normandy and Robert de<br> Belesme, whom the King Henry had before deprived of his lands,<br> and driven from England; and through their reconciliation the<br> King of England and the Earl of Normandy became adversaries.

The star<br> appeared in the south-west; it was thought little and dark; but<br> the train of light which stood from it was very bright, and<br> appeared like an immense beam shining north-east; and some<br> evening this beam was seen as if it were moving itself forwards<br> against the star. Some said that they saw more of such unusual<br> stars at this time; but we do not write more fully about it,<br> because we saw it not ourselves.

At Easter was the king at Bath, and at<br> Pentecost at Salisbury; because he would not hold his court when<br> he was beyond the sea. After this, and before August, went the<br> king over sea into Normandy; and almost all that were in that<br> land submitted to his will, except Robert de Belesme and the Earl<br> of Moretaine, and a few others of the principal persons who yet<br> held with the Earl of Normandy. For this reason the king<br> afterwards advanced with an army, and beset a castle of the Earl<br> of Moretaine, called Tenerchebrai.

And afterwards in<br> the beginning of August he was again at Westminster, and there<br> gave away and settled the bishoprics and abbacies that either in<br> England or in Normandy were without elders and pastors.

And whilst he was there,<br> he deprived of their lands the Earl of Evreux, and William<br> Crispin, and drove them out of Normandy. To Philip of Braiose he<br> restored his land, who had been before deprived of it; and Robert<br> of Belesme he suffered to be seized, and put into prison.

In this year held the King Henry his court on the<br> Nativity at Windsor, and held no other court afterwards during<br> the year. And at midsummer he went with an army into Wales; and<br> the Welsh came and made peace with the king. And he let men<br> build castles therein. And thereafter, in September, he went<br> over sea into Normandy. This year, in the latter end of May, was<br> seen an uncommon star with a long train, shining many nights. In<br> this year also was so great an ebb of the tide everywhere in one<br> day, as no man remembered before; so that men went riding and<br> walking over the Thames eastward of London bridge. This year<br> were very violent winds in the month of October; but it was<br> immoderately rough in the night of the octave of St. Martin; and<br> that was everywhere manifest both in town and country. In this<br> year also the king gave the archbishopric of Canterbury to Ralph,<br> who was before Bishop of Rochester; and Thomas, Archbishop of<br> York, died; and Turstein succeeded thereto, who was before the<br> king's chaplain. About this same time went the king toward the<br> sea, and was desirous of going over, but the weather prevented<br> him; then meanwhile sent he his writ after the Abbot Ernulf of<br> Peterborough, and bade that he should come to him quickly, for<br> that he wished to speak with him on an interesting subject. When<br> he came to him, he appointed him to the bishopric of Rochester;<br> and the archbishops and bishops and all the nobility that were in<br> England coincided with the king. And he long withstood, but it<br> availed nothing. And the king bade the archbishop that he should<br> lead him to Canterbury, and consecrate him bishop whether he<br> would or not. (143) This was done in the town called Bourne<br> (144) on the seventeenth day before the calends of October. When<br> the monks of Peterborough heard of this, they felt greater sorrow<br> than they had ever experienced before; because he was a very good<br> and amiable man, and did much good within and without whilst he<br> abode there. God Almighty abide ever with him. Soon after this<br> gave the king the abbacy to a monk of Sieyes, whose name was<br> John, through the intreaty of the Archbishop of Canterbury. And<br> soon after this the king and the Archbishop of Canterbury sent<br> him to Rome after the archbishop's pall; and a monk also with<br> him, whose name was Warner, and the Archdeacon John, the nephew<br> of the archbishop. And they sped well there. This was done on<br> the seventh day before the calends Of October, in the town that<br> is yclept Rowner.

This year was the King Henry on the Nativity in<br> Normandy. And whilst he was there, he contrived that all the<br> head men in Normandy did homage and fealty to his son William,<br> whom he had by his queen. And after this, in the month of July,<br> he returned to this land. This year was the winter so severe,<br> with snow and with frost, that no man who was then living ever<br> remembered one more severe; in consequence of which there was<br> great destruction of cattle. During this year the Pope Paschalis<br> sent the pall into this land to Ralph, Archbishop of Canterbury;<br> and he received it with great worship at his archiepiscopal stall<br> in Canterbury.

In this year was the King Henry on the Nativity at<br> St. Alban's, where he permitted the consecration of that<br> monastery; and at Easter he was at Odiham. And there was also<br> this year a very heavy-timed winter, strong and long, for cattle<br> and for all things. And the king soon after Easter went over sea<br> into Normandy. And there were many conspiracies and robberies,<br> and castles taken betwixt France and Normandy. Most of this<br> disturbance was because the King Henry assisted his nephew,<br> Theobald de Blois, who was engaged in a war against his lord,<br> Louis, the King of France. This was a very vexatious and<br> destructive year with respect to the fruits of the earth, through<br> the immoderate rains that fell soon after the beginning of<br> August, harassing and perplexing men till Candlemas-day. This<br> year also was so deficient in mast, that there was never heard<br> such in all this land or in Wales. This land and nation were<br> also this year oft and sorely swincked by the guilds which the<br> king took both within the boroughs and without. In this same<br> year was consumed by fire the whole monastery of Peterborough,<br> and all the buildings, except the chapter-house and the<br> dormitory, and therewith also all the greater part of the town.<br> All this happened on a Friday, which was the second day before<br> the nones of August.<br>assist<br>betwixt<br>borough<br>castle<br>cattle<br>consecration<br>conspiracy<br>engage<br>fall<br>fire<br>go_sea<br>guild<br>harass<br>hear<br>king<br>land<br>lord<br>monastery<br>nation<br>nephew<br>war", "A.D. 1117. All this year remained the King Henry, in Normandy,<br> on account of the hostility of the King of France and his other<br> neighbours. And in the summer came the King of France and the<br> Earl of Flanders with him with an army into Normandy. And having<br> stayed therein one night, they returned again in the morning<br> without fighting. But Normandy was very much afflicted both by<br> the exactions and by the armies which the King Henry collected<br> against them. This nation also was severely oppressed through<br> the same means, namely, through manifold exactions. This year<br> also, in the night of the calends of December, were immoderate<br> storms with thunder, and lightning, and rain, and hail. And in<br> the night of the third day before the ides of December was the<br> moon, during a long time of the night, as if covered with blood,<br> and afterwards eclipsed. Also in the night of the seventeenth<br> day before the calends of January, was the heaven seen very red,<br> as if it were burning. And on the octave of St. John the<br> Evangelist was the great earthquake in Lombardy; from the shock<br> of which many minsters, and towers, and houses fell, and did much<br> harm to men. This was a very blighted year in corn, through the<br> rains that scarcely ceased for nearly all the year. And the<br> Abbot Gilbert of Westminster died on the eighth day before the<br> ides of December; and Faritz, Abbot of Abingdon, on the seventh<br> day before the calends of March.

All this year abode the King Henry in Normandy on<br> account of the war of the King of France and the Earl of Anjou,<br> and the Earl of Flanders. And the Earl of Flanders was wounded<br> in Normandy, and went so wounded into Flanders. By this war was<br> the king much exhausted, and he was a great loser both in land<br> and money. And his own men grieved him most, who often from him<br> turned, and betrayed him; and going over to his foes surrendered<br> to them their castles, to the injury and disappointment of the<br> king. All this England dearly bought through the manifold guilds<br> that all this year abated not. This year, in the week of the<br> Epiphany, there was one evening a great deal of lightning, and<br> thereafter unusual thunder. And the Queen Matilda died at<br> Westminster on the calends of May; and there was buried. And the<br> Earl Robert of Mellent died also this year. In this year also,<br> on the feast of St. Thomas, was so very immoderately violent a<br> wind, that no man who was then living ever remembered any<br> greater; and that was everywhere seen both in houses and also in<br> trees.

All this year continued the King Henry in Normandy;<br> and he was greatly perplexed by the hostility of the King of<br> France, and also of his own men, who with treachery deserted from<br> him, and oft readily betrayed him; until the two kings came<br> together in Normandy with their forces. There was the King of<br> France put to flight, and all his best men taken. And afterwards<br> many of King Henry's men returned to him, and accorded with him,<br> who were before, with their castellans, against him. And some of<br> the castles he took by main strength. This year went William,<br> the son of King Henry and Queen Matilda, into Normandy to his<br> father, and there was given to him, and wedded to wife, the<br> daughter of the Earl of Anjou. On the eve of the mass of St.<br> Michael was much earth-heaving in some places in this land;<br> though most of all in Glocestershire and in Worcestershire. In<br> this same year died the Pope Gelasius, on this side of the Alps,<br> and was buried at Clugny. And after him the Archbishop of Vienna<br> was chosen pope, whose name was Calixtus. He afterwards, on the<br> festival of St. Luke the Evangelist, came into France to Rheims,<br> and there held a council. And the Archbishop Turstin of York<br> went thither; and, because that he against right, and against the<br> archiepiscopal stall in Canterbury, and against the king's will,<br> received his hood at the hands of the pope, the king interdicted<br> him from all return to England. And thus he lost his<br> archbishopric, and with the pope went towards Rome. In this year<br> also died the Earl Baldwin of Flanders of the wounds that he<br> received in Normandy.

From this time<br> forward the King Henry settled his castles and his land in<br> Normandy after his will; and so before Advent came to this land.<br> And in this expedition were drowned the king's two sons, William<br> and Richard, and Richard, Earl of Chester, and Ottuel his<br> brother, and very many of the king's household, stewards, and<br> chamberlains, and butlers, and men of various abodes; and with<br> them a countless multidude of very incomparable folk besides.<br> Sore was their death to their friends in a twofold respect: one,<br> that they so suddenly lost this life; the other, that few of<br> their bodies were found anywhere afterwards.

In this year was the King Henry at Christmas in<br> Norwich, and at Easter in Northampton. And in the Lent-tide<br> before that, the town of Glocester was on fire: the while that<br> the monks were singing their mass, and the deacon had begun the<br> gospel, \"Praeteriens Jesus\", at that very moment came the fire<br> from the upper part of the steeple, and burned all the minster,<br> and all the treasures that were there within; except a few books,<br> and three mass-hackles. That was on the eighth day before the<br> ides of Marcia. And thereafter, the Tuesday after Palm-Sunday,<br> was a very violent wind on the eleventh day before the calends of<br> April; after which came many tokens far and wide in England, and<br> many spectres were both seen and heard. And the eighth night<br> before the calends of August was a very violent earthquake over<br> all Somersetshire, and in Glocestershire. Soon after, on the<br> sixth day before the ides of September, which was on the festival<br> of St. Mary, (145) there was a very violent wind from the fore<br> part of the day to the depth of the night. This same year died<br> Ralph, the Archbishop of Canterbury; that was on the thirteenth<br> day before the calends of November. After this there were many<br> shipmen on the sea, and on fresh water, who said, that they saw<br> on the north-east, level with the earth, a fire huge and broad,<br> which anon waxed in length up to the welkin; and the welkin undid<br> itself in four parts, and fought against it, as if it would<br> quench it; and the fire waxed nevertheless up to the heaven.

In this year was the King Henry, at Christmastide at<br> Dunstable, and there came to him the ambassadors of the Earl of<br> Anjou. And thence he went to Woodstock; and his bishops and his<br> whole court with him. Then did it betide on a Wednesday, which<br> was on the fourth day before the ides of January, that the king<br> rode in his deer-fold; (146) the Bishop Roger of Salisbury (147)<br> on one side of him, and the Bishop Robert Bloet of Lincoln on the<br> other side of him. And they rode there talking together. Then<br> sank down the Bishop of Lincoln, and said to the king, \"Lord<br> king, I die.\" And the king alighted down from his horse, and<br> lifted him betwixt his arms, and let men bear him home to his<br> inn. There he was soon dead; and they carried him to Lincoln<br> with great worship, and buried him before the altar of St. Mary.<br> And the Bishop of Chester, whose name was Robert Pecceth, buried<br> him. Soon after this sent the king his writ over all England,<br> and bade all his bishops and his abbots and his thanes, that they<br> should come to his wittenmoot on Candlemas day at Glocester to<br> meet him: and they did so. When they were there gathered<br> together, then the king bade them, that they should choose for<br> themselves an Archbishop of Canterbury, whomsoever they would,<br> and he would confirm it. Then spoke the bishops among<br> themselves, and said that they never more would have a man of the<br> monastic order as archbishop over them. And they went all in a<br> body to the king, and earnestly requested that they might choose<br> from the clerical order whomsoever they would for archbishop.<br> And the king granted it to them. This was all concerted before,<br> through the Bishop of Salisbury, and through the Bishop of<br> Lincoln ere he was dead; for that they never loved the rule of<br> monks, but were ever against monks and their rule. And the prior<br> and the monks of Canterbury, and all the other persons of the<br> monastic order that were there, withstood it full two days; but<br> it availed nought: for the Bishop of Salisbury was strong, and<br> wielded all England, and opposed them with all his power and<br> might. Then chose they a clerk, named William of Curboil. He<br> was canon of a monastery called Chiche. (148) And they brought<br> him before the king; and the king gave him the archbishopric.<br> And all the bishops received him: but almost all the monks, and<br> the earls, and the thanes that were there, protested against him.<br> About the same time departed the earl's messengers (149) in<br> hostility from the king, reckless of his favour. During the same<br> time came a legate from Rome, whose name was Henry. He was abbot<br> of the monastery of St. John of Angeli; and he came after the<br> Rome-scot. And he said to the king, that it was against right<br> that men should set a clerk over monks; and therefore they had<br> chosen an archbishop before in their chapter after right. But<br> the king would not undo it, for the love of the Bishop of<br> Salisbury. Then went the archbishop, soon after this, to<br> Canterbury; and was there received, though it was against their<br> will; and he was there soon blessed to bishop by the Bishop of<br> London, and the Bishop Ernulf of Rochester, and the Bishop<br> William Girard of Winchester, and the Bishop Bernard of Wales,<br> and the Bishop Roger of Salisbury. Then, early in Lent, went<br> the archbishop to Rome, after his pall; and with him went the<br> Bishop Bernard of Wales; and Sefred, Abbot of Glastonbury; and<br> Anselm, Abbot of St. Edmund's bury; and John, Archdeacon of<br> Canterbury; and Gifard, who was the king's court-chaplain. At<br> the same time went the Archbishop Thurstan of York to Rome,<br> through the behest of the pope, and came thither three days ere<br> the Archbishop of Canterbury came, and was there received with<br> much worship. Then came the Archbishop of Canterbury, and was<br> there full seven nights ere they could come to a conference with<br> the pope. That was, because the pope was made to understand that<br> he had obtained the archbishopric against the monks of the<br> minster, and against right. But that overcame Rome, which<br> overcometh all the world; that is, gold and silver. And the pope<br> softened, and gave him his pall. And the archbishop (of York)<br> swore him subjection, in all those things, which the pope<br> enjoined him, by the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul; and the<br> pope then sent him home with his blessing. The while that the<br> archbishop was out of the land, the king gave the bishopric of<br> Bath to the Queen's chancellor, whose name was Godfrey. He was<br> born in Louvain. That was on the Annunciation of St. Mary, at<br> Woodstock. Soon after this went the king to Winchester, and was<br> all Easter-tide there. And the while that he was there, gave he<br> the bishopric of Lincoln to a clerk hight Alexander. He was<br> nephew of the Bishop of Salisbury. This he did all for the love<br> of the bishop. Then went the king thence to Portsmouth, and lay<br> there all over Pentecost week. Then, as soon as he had a fair<br> wind, he went over into Normandy; and meanwhile committed all<br> England to the guidance and government of the Bishop Roger of<br> Salisbury. Then was the king all this year (150) in Normandy.<br> And much hostility arose betwixt him and his thanes; so that the<br> Earl Waleram of Mellent, and Hamalric, and Hugh of Montfort, and<br> William of Romare, and many others, went from him, and held their<br> castles against him. And the king strongly opposed them: and<br> this same year he won of Waleram his castle of Pont-Audemer, and<br> of Hugh that of Montfort; and ever after, the longer he stayed,<br> the better he sped. This same year, ere the Bishop of Lincoln<br> came to his bishopric, almost all the borough of Lincoln was<br> burned, and numberless folks, men and women, were consumed: and<br> so much harm was there done as no man could describe to another.<br> That was on the fourteenth day before the calends of June.<br>abbot<br>altar<br>archbishop<br>archbishopric<br>arise<br>betwixt<br>bishop<br>bishop_abbot<br>bishopric<br>bless<br>blessing<br>body<br>borough<br>burn<br>bury<br>call<br>castle<br>choose<br>clerk<br>commit<br>confirm<br>court<br>dead<br>depart<br>die<br>earl<br>ere<br>fair<br>folk<br>gather<br>give_bishopric<br>gold_silver<br>government<br>great_worship<br>horse<br>hostility<br>king<br>land<br>lie<br>lord<br>love<br>messenger<br>minster<br>monastery<br>monk<br>nephew<br>obtain<br>overcome<br>pall<br>pope<br>receive<br>rule<br>scot<br>sink<br>speak<br>speed<br>swear<br>thane<br>wind<br>worship", "A.D. 1124. All this year was the King Henry in Normandy. That<br> was for the great hostility that he had with the King Louis of<br> France, and with the Earl of Anjou, and most of all with his own<br> men. Then it happened, on the day of the Annunciation of St.<br> Mary, that the Earl Waleram of Mellent went from one of his<br> castles called Belmont to another called Watteville. With him<br> went the steward of the King of France, Amalric, and Hugh the son<br> of Gervase, and Hugh of Montfort, and many other good knights.<br> Then came against them the king's knights from all the castles<br> that were thereabout, and fought with them, and put them to<br> flight, and took the Earl Waleram, and Hugh, the son of Gervase,<br> and Hugh of Montfort, and five and twenty other knights, and<br> brought them to the king. And the king committed the Earl<br> Waleram, and Hugh, the son of Gervase, to close custody in the<br> castle at Rouen; but Hugh of Montfort he sent to England, and<br> ordered him to be secured with strong bonds in the castle at<br> Glocester. And of the others as many as he chose he sent north<br> and south to his castles in captivity. After this went the king,<br> and won all the castles of the Earl Waleram that were in<br> Normandy, and all the others that his enemies held against him.<br> All this hostility was on account of the son of the Earl Robert<br> of Normandy, named William. This same William had taken to wife<br> the younger daughter of Fulke, Earl of Anjou: and for this reason<br> the King of France and all the earls held with him, and all the<br> rich men; and said that the king held his brother Robert<br> wrongfully in captivity, and drove his son William unjustly out<br> of Normandy. This same year were the seasons very unfavourable<br> in England for corn and all fruits; so that between Christmas and<br> Candlemas men sold the acre-seed of wheat, that is two seedlips,<br> for six shillings; and the barley, that is three seedlips, for<br> six shillings also; and the acre-seed of oats, that is four<br> seedlips, for four shillings. That was because that corn was<br> scarce; and the penny was so adulterated, (151) that a man who<br> had a pound at a market could not exchange twelve pence thereof<br> for anything. In this same year died the blessed Bishop Ernulf<br> of Rochester, who before was Abbot of Peterborough. That was on<br> the ides of March. And after this died the King Alexander of<br> Scotland, on the ninth day before the calends of May. And David<br> his brother, who was Earl of Northamptonshire, succeeded to the<br> kingdom; and had both together, the kingdom of Scotland and the<br> earldom in England. And on the nineteenth day before the calends<br> of January died the Pope of Rome, whose name was Calixtus, and<br> Honorius succeeded to the popedom. This same year, after St.<br> Andrew's mass, and before Christmas, held Ralph Basset and the<br> king's thanes a wittenmoot in Leicestershire, at Huncothoe, and<br> there hanged more thieves than ever were known before; that is,<br> in a little while, four and forty men altogether; and despoiled<br> six men of their eyes and of their testicles. Many true men said<br> that there were several who suffered very unjustly; but our Lord<br> God Almighty, who seeth and knoweth every secret, seeth also that<br> the wretched people are oppressed with all unrighteousness.<br> First they are bereaved of their property, and then they are<br> slain.

In this year sent the King Henry, before Christmas,<br> from Normandy to England, and bade that all the mint-men that<br> were in England should be mutilated in their limbs; that was,<br> that they should lose each of them the right hand, and their<br> testicles beneath. This was because the man that had a pound<br> could not lay out a penny at a market. And the Bishop Roger of<br> Salisbury sent over all England, and bade them all that they<br> should come to Winchester at Christmas. When they came thither,<br> then were they taken one by one, and deprived each of the right<br> hand and the testicles beneath. All this was done within the<br> twelfth-night. And that was all in perfect justice, because that<br> they had undone all the land with the great quantity of base coin<br> that they all bought. In this same year sent the Pope of Rome to<br> this land a cardinal, named John of Crema. He came first to the<br> king in Normandy, and the king received him with much worship.<br> He betook himself then to the Archbishop William of Canterbury;<br> and he led him to Canterbury; and he was there received with<br> great veneration, and in solemn procession. And he sang the high<br> mass on Easter day at the altar of Christ. Afterwards he went<br> over all England, to all the bishoprics and abbacies that were in<br> this land; and in all he was received with respect. And all gave<br> him many and rich gifts. And afterwards he held his council in<br> London full three days, on the Nativity of St. Mary in September,<br> with archbishops, and diocesan bishops, and abbots, the learned<br> and the lewd; (152) and enjoined there the same laws that<br> Archbishop Anselm had formerly enjoined, and many more, though it<br> availed little. Thence he went over sea soon after Michaelmas,<br> and so to Rome; and (with him) the Archbishop William of<br> Canterbury, and the Archbishop Thurstan of York, and the Bishop<br> Alexander of Lincoln, and the Bishop J. of Lothian, and the Abbot<br> G. of St. Alban's; and were there received by the Pope Honorius<br> with great respect; and continued there all the winter. In this<br> same year was so great a flood on St. Laurence's day, that many<br> towns and men were overwhelmed, and bridges broken down, and corn<br> and meadows spoiled withal; and hunger and qualm (153) in men and<br> in cattle; and in all fruits such unseasonableness as was not<br> known for many years before. And this same year died the Abbot<br> John of Peterborough, on the second day before the ides of<br> October.<br>abbot<br>altar<br>archbishop<br>bishop<br>bishop_abbot<br>bridge<br>buy<br>cattle<br>corn<br>council<br>deprive<br>die<br>fruit<br>gift<br>go_sea<br>hunger<br>king<br>land<br>law<br>lose<br>mass_day<br>pope<br>receive<br>spoil<br>worship", "A.D. 1126. All this year was the King Henry in Normandy--all<br> till after harvest. Then came he to this land, betwixt the<br> Nativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas. With him came the queen,<br> and his daughter, whom he had formerly given to the Emperor Henry<br> of Lorrain to wife. And he brought with him the Earl Waleram,<br> and Hugh, the son of Gervase. And the earl he sent to<br> Bridgenorth in captivity: and thence he sent him afterwards to<br> Wallingford; and Hugh to Windsor, whom he ordered to be kept in<br> strong bonds. Then after Michaelmas came David, the king of the<br> Scots, from Scotland to this land; and the King Henry received<br> him with great worship; and he continued all that year in this<br> land. In this year the king had his brother Robert taken from<br> the Bishop Roger of Salisbury, and committed him to his son<br> Robert, Earl of Glocester, and had him led to Bristol, and there<br> put into the castle. That was all done through his daughter's<br> counsel, and through David, the king of the Scots, her uncle.<br>betwixt<br>bishop<br>brother<br>castle<br>commit<br>counsel<br>daughter<br>earl<br>emperor<br>great_worship<br>harvest<br>king<br>land<br>receive<br>son<br>uncle<br>wife", "A.D. 1127. This year held the King Henry his court at Christmas<br> in Windsor. There was David the king of the Scots, and all the<br> head men that were in England, learned and lewd. And there he<br> engaged the archbishops, and bishops, and abbots, and earls, and<br> all the thanes that were there, to swear England and Normandy<br> after his day into the hands of his daughter Athelicia, who was<br> formerly the wife of the Emperor of Saxony. Afterwards he sent<br> her to Normandy; and with her went her brother Robert, Earl of<br> Glocester, and Brian, son of the Earl Alan Fergan; (154) and he<br> let her wed the son of the Earl of Anjou, whose name was Geoffry<br> Martel. All the French and English, however, disapproved of<br> this; but the king did it for to have the alliance of the Earl<br> of Anjou, and for to have help against his nephew William. In<br> the Lent-tide of this same year was the Earl Charles of Flanders<br> slain in a church, as he lay there and prayed to God, before the<br> altar, in the midst of the mass, by his own men. And the King of<br> France brought William, the son of the Earl of Normandy, and gave<br> him the earldom; and the people of that land accepted him. This<br> same William had before taken to wife the daughter of the Earl of<br> Anjou; but they were afterwards divorced on the plea of<br> consanguinity. This was all through the King Henry of England.<br> Afterwards took he to wife the sister of the king's wife of<br> France; and for this reason the king gave him the earldom of<br> Flanders. This same year he (155) gave the abbacy of<br> Peterborough to an abbot named Henry of Poitou, who retained in<br> hand his abbacy of St. John of Angeli; but all the archbishops<br> and bishops said that it was against right, and that he could not<br> have two abbacies on hand. But the same Henry gave the king to<br> understand, that he had relinquished his abbacy on account of the<br> great hostility that was in the land; and that he did through the<br> counsel and leave of the Pope of Rome, and through that of the<br> Abbot of Clugny, and because he was legate of the Rome-scot.<br> But, nevertheless, it was not so; for he would retain both in<br> hand; and did so as long as God's will was. He was in his<br> clerical state Bishop of Soissons; afterwards monk of Clugny; and<br> then prior in the same monastery. Afterwards he became prior of<br> Sevigny; and then, because he was a relation of the King of<br> England, and of the Earl of Poitou, the earl gave him the abbacy<br> of St. John's minster of Angeli. Afterwards, through his great<br> craft, he obtained the archbishopric of Besancon; and had it in<br> hand three days; after which he justly lost it, because he had<br> before unjustly obtained it. Afterwards he procured the<br> bishopric of Saintes; which was five miles from his abbey. That<br> he had full-nigh a week (156) in hand; but the Abbot of Clugny<br> brought him thence, as he before did from Besancon. Then he<br> bethought him, that, if he could be fast-rooted in England, he<br> might have all his will. Wherefore he besought the king, and<br> said unto him, that he was an old man--a man completely broken--that<br> he could not brook the great injustice and the great<br> hostility that were in their land: and then, by his own<br> endearours, and by those of all his friends, he earnestly and<br> expressly entreated for the abbacy of Peterborough. And the king<br> procured it for him, because he was his relation, and because he<br> was the principal person to make oath and bear witness when the<br> son of the Earl of Normandy and the daughter of the Earl of Anjou<br> were divorced on the plea of consanguinity. Thus wretchedly was<br> the abbacy given away, betwixt Christmas and Candlemas, at<br> London; and so he went with the King to Winchester, and thence he<br> came to Peterborough, and there he dwelt (157) right so as a<br> drone doth in a hive. For as the drone fretteth and draggeth<br> fromward all that the bees drag toward [the hive], so did<br> he.--All that he might take, within and without, of learned and lewd,<br> so sent he over sea; and no good did there--no good left there.<br> Think no man unworthily that we say not the truth; for it was<br> fully known over all the land: that, as soon as he came thither,<br> which was on the Sunday when men sing \"Exurge quare o D---- etc.\"<br> immediately after, several persons saw and heard many huntsmen<br> hunting. The hunters were swarthy, and huge, and ugly; and their<br> hounds were all swarthy, and broad-eyed, and ugly. And they rode<br> on swarthy horses, and swarthy bucks. This was seen in the very<br> deer-fold in the town of Peterborough, and in all the woods from<br> that same town to Stamford. And the monks heard the horn blow<br> that they blew in the night. Credible men, who watched them in<br> the night, said that they thought there might well be about<br> twenty or thirty horn-blowers. This was seen and heard from the<br> time that he (158) came thither, all the Lent-tide onward to<br> Easter. This was his entry; of his exit we can as yet say<br> nought.

All this year was the King Henry in Normandy, on<br> account of the hostility that was between him and his nephew, the<br> Earl of Flanders. But the earl was wounded in a fight by a<br> swain; and so wounded he went to the monastery of St. Bertin;<br> where he soon became a monk, lived five days afterwards, then<br> died, and was there buried. God honour his soul. That was on<br> the sixth day before the calends of August. This same year died<br> the Bishop Randulph Passeflambard of Durham; and was there buried<br> on the nones of September. And this same year went the aforesaid<br> Abbot Henry home to his own minster at Poitou by the king's<br> leave. He gave the king to understand, that he would withal<br> forgo that minster, and that land, and dwell with him in England,<br> and in the monastery of Peterborough. But it was not so<br> nevertheless. He did this because he would be there, through his<br> crafty wiles, were it a twelvemonth or more, and come again<br> afterwards. May God Almighty extend his mercy over that wretched<br> place. This same year came from Jerusalem Hugh of the Temple to<br> the king in Normandy; and the king received him with much honour,<br> and gave him rich presents in gold and in silver. And afterwards<br> he sent him into England; and there he was received by all good<br> men, who all gave him presents, and in Scotland also: and by him<br> they sent to Jerusalem much wealth withal in gold and in silver.<br> And he invited folk out to Jerusalem; and there went with him and<br> after him more people than ever did before, since that the first<br> expedition was in the day of Pope Urban. Though it availed<br> little; for he said, that a mighty war was begun between the<br> Christians and the heathens; but when they came thither, then was<br> it nought but leasing.

In this year sent the King to England after the Earl<br> Waleram, and after Hugh, the son of Gervase. And they gave<br> hostages for them. And Hugh went home to his own land in France;<br> but Waleram was left with the king: and the king gave him all his<br> land except his castle alone. Afterwards came the king to<br> England within the harvest: and the earl came with him: and they<br> became as good friends as they were foes before. Soon after, by<br> the king's counsel, and by his leave, sent the Archbishop William<br> of Canterbury over all England, and bade bishops, and abbots, and<br> archdeacons, and all the priors, monks, and canons, that were in<br> all the cells in England, and all who had the care and<br> superintendence of christianity, that they should all come to<br> London at Michaelmas, and there should speak of all God's rights.<br> When they came thither, then began the moot on Monday, and<br> continued without intermission to the Friday. When it all came<br> forth, then was it all found to be about archdeacons' wives, and<br> about priests' wives; that they should forgo them by St. Andrew's<br> mass; and he who would not do that, should forgo his church, and<br> his house, and his home, and never more have any calling thereto.<br> This bade the Archbishop William of Canterbury, and all the<br> diocesan bishops that were then in England, but the king gave<br> them all leave to go home. And so they went home; and all the<br> ordinances amounted to nothing. All held their wives by the<br> king's leave as they did before. This same year died the Bishop<br> William Giffard of Winchester; and was there buried, on the<br> eighth day before the calends of February. And the King Henry<br> gave the bishopric after Michaelmas to the Abbot Henry of<br> Glastonbury, his nephew, and he was consecrated bishop by the<br> Archbishop William of Canterbury on the fifteenth day before the<br> calends of December. This same year died Pope Honorius. Ere he<br> was well dead, there were chosen two popes. The one was named<br> Peter, who was monk of Clugny, and was born of the richest men of<br> Rome; and with him held those of Rome, and the Duke of Sicily.<br> The other was Gregory: he was a clerk, and was driven out of Rome<br> by the other pope, and by his kinsmen. With him held the Emperor<br> of Saxony, and the King of France, and the King Henry of England,<br> and all those on this side of the Alps. Now was there such<br> division in Christendom as never was before. May Christ consult<br> for his wretched folk.

This year was the monastery of Canterbury consecrated<br> by the Archbishop William, on the fourth day before the nones of<br> May. There were the Bishops John of Rochester, Gilbert Universal<br> of London, Henry of Winchester, Alexander of Lincoln, Roger of<br> Salisbury, Simon of Worcester, Roger of Coventry, Geoffry of<br> Bath, Evrard of Norwich, Sigefrith of Chichester, Bernard of St.<br> David's, Owen of Evreux in Normandy, John of Sieyes. On the<br> fourth day after this was the King Henry in Rochester, when the<br> town was almost consumed by fire; and the Archbishop William<br> consecrated the monastery of St. Andrew, and the aforesaid<br> bishops with him. And the King Henry went over sea into Normandy<br> in harvest. This same year came the Abbot Henry of Angeli after<br> Easter to Peterborough, and said that he had relinquished that<br> monastery (161) withal. After him came the Abbot of Clugny,<br> Peter by name, to England by the king's leave; and was received<br> by all, whithersoever he came, with much respect. To<br> Peterborough he came; and there the Abbot Henry promised him that<br> he would procure him the minster of Peterborough, that it might<br> be subject to Clugny. But it is said in the proverb,<br> \"The hedge abideth,<br> that acres divideth.\"<br> May God Almighty frustrate evil designs. Soon after this, went<br> the Abbot of Clugny home to his country.

This year, after Christmas, on a Monday night, at the<br> first sleep, was the heaven on the northern hemisphere (162) all<br> as if it were burning fire; so that all who saw it were so<br> dismayed as they never were before. That was on the third day<br> before the ides of January. This same year was so great a<br> murrain of cattle as never was before in the memory of man over<br> all England. That was in neat cattle and in swine; so that in a<br> town where there were ten ploughs going, or twelve, there was not<br> left one: and the man that had two hundred or three hundred<br> swine, had not one left. Afterwards perished the hen fowls; then<br> shortened the fleshmeat, and the cheese, and the butter. May God<br> better it when it shall be his will. And the King Henry came<br> home to England before harvest, after the mass of St. Peter \"ad<br> vincula\". This same year went the Abbot Henry, before Easter,<br> from Peterborough over sea to Normandy, and there spoke with the<br> king, and told him that the Abbot of Clugny had desired him to<br> come to him, and resign to him the abbacy of Angeli, after which<br> he would go home by his leave. And so he went home to his own<br> minster, and there remained even to midsummer day. And the next<br> day after the festival of St. John chose the monks an abbot of<br> themselves, brought him into the church in procession, sang \"Te<br> Deum laudamus\", rang the bells, set him on the abbot's throne,<br> did him all homage, as they should do their abbot: and the earl,<br> and all the head men, and the monks of the minster, drove the<br> other Abbot Henry out of the monastery. And they had need; for<br> in five-and-twenty winters had they never hailed one good day.<br> Here failed him all his mighty crafts. Now it behoved him, that<br> he crope in his skin into every corner, if peradventure there<br> were any unresty wrench, (163) whereby he might yet once more<br> betray Christ and all Christian people. Then retired he into<br> Clugny, where he was held so fast, that he could not move east or<br> west. The Abbot of Clugny said that they had lost St. John's<br> minster through him, and through his great sottishness. Then<br> could he not better recompense them; but he promised them, and<br> swore oaths on the holy cross, that if he might go to England he<br> should get them the minster of Peterborough; so that he should<br> set there the prior of Clugny, with a churchwarden, a treasurer,<br> and a sacristan: and all the things that were within the minster<br> and without, he should procure for them. Thus he departed into<br> France; and there remained all that year. Christ provide for the<br> wretched monks of Peterborough, and for that wretched place.

This year came King Henry to this land. Then came<br> Abbot Henry, and betrayed the monks of Peterborough to the king,<br> because he would subject that minster to Clugny; so that the king<br> was well nigh entrapped, and sent after the monks. But through<br> the grace of God, and through the Bishop of Salisbury, and the<br> Bishop of Lincoln, and the other rich men that were there, the<br> king knew that he proceeded with treachery. When he no more<br> could do, then would he that his nephew should be Abbot of<br> Peterborough. But Christ forbade. Not very long after this was<br> it that the king sent after him, and made him give up the Abbey<br> of Peterborough, and go out of the land.

In this year went the King Henry over sea at the<br> Lammas; and the next day, as he lay asleep on ship, the day<br> darkened over all lands, and the sun was all as it were a three<br> night old moon, and the stars about him at midday. Men were very<br> much astonished and terrified, and said that a great event should<br> come hereafter. So it did; for that same year was the king dead,<br> the next day after St. Andrew's mass-day, in Normandy. Then was<br> there soon tribulation in the land; for every man that might,<br> soon robbed another. Then his sons and his friends took his<br> body, and brought it to England, and buried it at Reading. A<br> good man he was; and there was great dread of him. No man durst<br> do wrong with another in his time. Peace he made for man and<br> beast. Whoso bare his burthen of gold and silver, durst no man<br> say ought to him but good. Meanwhile was his nephew come to<br> England, Stephen de Blois. He came to London, and the people of<br> London received him, and sent after the Archbishop William<br> Curboil, and hallowed him to king on midwinter day. In this<br> king's time was all dissention, and evil, and rapine; for against<br> him rose soon the rich men who were traitors; and first of all<br> Baldwin de Redvers, who held Exeter against him. But the king<br> beset it; and afterwards Baldwin accorded. Then took the others,<br> and held their castles against him; and David, King of Scotland,<br> took to Wessington against him.

This year went the King Stephen over sea to Normandy,<br> and there was received; for that they concluded that he should be<br> all such as the uncle was; and because he had got his treasure:<br> but he dealed it out, and scattered it foolishly. Much had King<br> Henry gathered, gold and silver, but no good did men for his soul<br> thereof. When the King Stephen came to England, he held his<br> council at Oxford; where he seized the Bishop Roger of Sarum, and<br> Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and the chancellor Roger, his<br> nephew; and threw all into prison till they gave up their<br> castles. When the traitors understood that he was a mild man,<br> and soft, and good, and no justice executed, then did they all<br> wonder. They had done him homage, and sworn oaths, but they no<br> truth maintained. They were all forsworn, and forgetful of their<br> troth; for every rich man built his castles, which they held<br> against him: and they filled the land full of castles. They<br> cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle-works;<br> and when the castles were made, they filled them with devils and<br> evil men. Then took they those whom they supposed to have any<br> goods, both by night and by day, labouring men and women, and<br> threw them into prison for their gold and silver, and inflicted<br> on them unutterable tortures; for never were any martyrs so<br> tortured as they were. Some they hanged up by the feet, and<br> smoked them with foul smoke; and some by the thumbs, or by the<br> head, and hung coats of mail on their feet. They tied knotted<br> strings about their heads, and twisted them till the pain went to<br> the brains. They put them into dungeons, wherein were adders,<br> and snakes, and toads; and so destroyed them. Some they placed<br> in a crucet-house; that is, in a chest that was short and narrow,<br> and not deep; wherein they put sharp stones, and so thrust the<br> man therein, that they broke all the limbs. In many of the<br> castles were things loathsome and grim, called \"Sachenteges\", of<br> which two or three men had enough to bear one. It was thus made:<br> that is, fastened to a beam; and they placed a sharp iron<br> [collar] about the man's throat and neck, so that he could in no<br> direction either sit, or lie, or sleep, but bear all that iron.<br> Many thousands they wore out with hunger. I neither can, nor may<br> I tell all the wounds and all the pains which they inflicted on<br> wretched men in this land. This lasted the nineteen winters<br> while Stephen was king; and it grew continually worse and worse.<br> They constantly laid guilds on the towns, and called it<br> \"tenserie\"; and when the wretched men had no more to give, then<br> they plundered and burned all the towns; that well thou mightest<br> go a whole day's journey and never shouldest thou find a man<br> sitting in a town, nor the land tilled. Then was corn dear, and<br> flesh, and cheese, and butter; for none was there in the land.<br> Wretched men starved of hunger. Some had recourse to alms, who<br> were for a while rich men, and some fled out of the land. Never<br> yet was there more wretchedness in the land; nor ever did heathen<br> men worse than they did: for, after a time, they spared neither<br> church nor churchyard, but took all the goods that were therein,<br> and then burned the church and all together. Neither did they<br> spare a bishop's land, or an abbot's, or a priest's, but<br> plundered both monks and clerks; and every man robbed another who<br> could. If two men, or three, came riding to a town, all the<br> township fled for them, concluding them to be robbers. The<br> bishops and learned men cursed them continually, but the effect<br> thereof was nothing to them; for they were all accursed, and<br> forsworn, and abandoned. To till the ground was to plough the<br> sea: the earth bare no corn, for the land was all laid waste by<br> such deeds; and they said openly, that Christ slept, and his<br> saints. Such things, and more than we can say, suffered we<br> nineteen winters for our sins. In all this evil time held Abbot<br> Martin his abbacy twenty years and a half, and eight days, with<br> much tribulation; and found the monks and the guests everything<br> that behoved them; and held much charity in the house; and,<br> notwithstanding all this, wrought on the church, and set thereto<br> lands and rents, and enriched it very much, and bestowed<br> vestments upon it. And he brought them into the new minster on<br> St. Peter's mass-day with much pomp; which was in the year, from<br> the incarnation of our Lord, 1140, and in the twenty-third from<br> the destruction of the place by fire. And he went to Rome, and<br> there was well received by the Pope Eugenius; from whom he<br> obtained their privileges:--one for all the lands of the abbey,<br> and another for the lands that adjoin to the churchyard; and, if<br> he might have lived longer, so he meant to do concerning the<br> treasury. And he got in the lands that rich men retained by main<br> strength. Of William Malduit, who held the castle of Rockingham,<br> he won Cotingham and Easton; and of Hugh de Walteville, he won<br> Hirtlingbury and Stanwick, and sixty shillings from Oldwinkle<br> each year. And he made many monks, and planted a vine-yard, and<br> constructed many works, and made the town better than it was<br> before. He was a good monk, and a good man; and for this reason<br> God and good men loved him. Now we will relate in part what<br> happened in King Stephen's time. In his reign the Jews of<br> Norwich bought a Christian child before Easter, and tortured him<br> after the same manner as our Lord was tortured; and on Long-Friday<br> (164) hanged him on a rood, in mockery of our Lord, and<br> afterwards buried him. They supposed that it would be concealed,<br> but our Lord showed that he was a holy martyr. And the monks<br> took him, and buried him with high honour in the minster.

In this year came David, King of Scotland, with an<br> immense army to this land. He was ambitious to win this land;<br> but against him came William, Earl of Albemarle, to whom the king<br> had committed York, and other borderers, with few men, and fought<br> against them, and routed the king at the Standard, and slew very<br> many of his gang.<br>army<br>commit<br>earl<br>fight<br>king<br>land<br>slay<br>win_land", "A.D. 1140. In this year wished the King Stephen to take Robert,<br> Earl of Gloucester, the son of King Henry; but he could not, for<br> he was aware of it. After this, in the Lent, the sun and the day<br> darkened about the noon-tide of the day, when men were eating;<br> and they lighted candles to eat by. That was the thirteenth day<br> before the kalends of April. Men were very much struck with<br> wonder. Thereafter died William, Archbishop of Canterbury; and<br> the king made Theobald archbishop, who was Abbot of Bec. After<br> this waxed a very great war betwixt the king and Randolph, Earl<br> of Chester; not because he did not give him all that he could ask<br> him, as he did to all others; but ever the more he gave them, the<br> worse they were to him. The Earl held Lincoln against the king,<br> and took away from him all that he ought to have. And the king<br> went thither, and beset him and his brother William de Romare in<br> the castle. And the earl stole out, and went after Robert, Earl<br> of Glocester, and brought him thither with a large army. And<br> they fought strenuously on Candlemas day against their lord, and<br> took him; for his men forsook him and fled. And they led him to<br> Bristol, and there put him into prison in close quarters. Then<br> was all England stirred more than ere was, and all evil was in<br> the land. Afterwards came the daughter of King Henry, who had<br> been Empress of Germany, and now was Countess of Anjou. She came<br> to London; but the people of London attempted to take her, and<br> she fled, losing many of her followers. After this the Bishop of<br> Winchester, Henry, the brother of King Stephen, spake with Earl<br> Robert, and with the empress, and swore them oaths, \"that he<br> never more would hold with the king, his brother,\" and cursed all<br> the men that held with him, and told them, that he would give<br> them up Winchester; and he caused them to come thither. When<br> they were therein, then came the king's queen with all her<br> strength, and beset them, so that there was great hunger therein.<br> When they could no longer hold out, then stole they out, and<br> fled; but those without were aware, and followed them, and took<br> Robert, Earl of Glocester, and led him to Rochester, and put him<br> there into prison; but the empress fled into a monastery. Then<br> went the wise men between the king's friends and the earl's<br> friends; and settled so that they should let the king out of<br> prison for the earl, and the earl for the king; and so they did.<br> After this settled the king and Earl Randolph at Stamford, and<br> swore oaths, and plighted their troth, that neither should betray<br> the other. But it availed nothing. For the king afterwards took<br> him at Northampton, through wicked counsel, and put him into<br> prison; and soon after he let him out again, through worse<br> counsel, on the condition that he swore by the crucifix, and<br> found hostages, that he would give up all his castles. Some he<br> gave up, and some gave he not up; and did then worse than he<br> otherwise would. Then was England very much divided. Some held<br> with the king, and some with the empress; for when the king was<br> in prison, the earls and the rich men supposed that he never more<br> would come out: and they settled with the empress, and brought<br> her into Oxford, and gave her the borough. When the king was<br> out, he heard of this, and took his force, and beset her in the<br> tower. (165) And they let her down in the night from the tower<br> by ropes. And she stole out, and fled, and went on foot to<br> Wallingford. Afterwards she went over sea; and those of Normandy<br> turned all from the king to the Earl of Anjou; some willingly,<br> and some against their will; for he beset them till they gave up<br> their castles, and they had no help of the king. Then went<br> Eustace, the king's son, to France, and took to wife the sister<br> of the King of France. He thought to obtain Normandy thereby;<br> but he sped little, and by good right; for he was an evil man.<br> Wherever he was, he did more evil than good; he robbed the lands,<br> and levied heavy guilds upon them. He brought his wife to<br> England, and put her into the castle at... (166) Good woman she<br> was; but she had little bliss with him; and Christ would not that<br> he should long reign. He therefore soon died, and his mother<br> also. And the Earl of Anjou died; and his son Henry took to the<br> earldom. And the Queen of France parted from the king; and she<br> came to the young Earl Henry; and he took her to wife, and all<br> Poitou with her. Then went he with a large force into England,<br> and won some castles; and the king went against him with a much<br> larger force. Nevertheless, fought they not; but the archbishop<br> and the wise men went between them, and made this settlement:<br> That the king should be lord and king while he lived, and after<br> his day Henry should be king: that Henry should take him for a<br> father; and he him for a son: that peace and union should be<br> betwixt them, and in all England. This and the other provisions<br> that they made, swore the king and the earl to observe; and all<br> the bishops, and the earls, and the rich men. Then was the earl<br> received at Winchester, and at London, with great worship; and<br> all did him homage, and swore to keep the peace. And there was<br> soon so good a peace as never was there before. Then was the<br> king stronger than he ever was before. And the earl went over<br> sea; and all people loved him; for he did good justice, and made<br> peace.<br>abbot<br>archbishop<br>betray<br>betwixt<br>bishop<br>bliss<br>borough<br>brother<br>castle<br>counsel<br>daughter<br>die<br>do_homage<br>earl<br>ere<br>evil<br>father<br>fight<br>flee<br>force<br>forsook<br>friend<br>give_castle<br>go_sea<br>great_worship<br>guild<br>hear<br>hostage<br>hunger<br>king<br>land<br>large_army<br>lord<br>lose<br>love<br>make_peace<br>monastery<br>mother<br>obtain<br>peace<br>prison<br>provision<br>receive<br>reign<br>rich_man<br>settle<br>sister<br>son<br>speed<br>steal<br>strength<br>sun<br>swear<br>swear_oath<br>take_wife<br>war<br>wife<br>wise_man", "A.D. 1154.

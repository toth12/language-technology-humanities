Rendering the Feature Space representing the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Through Projection to a Lower-Dimensional Space began


The output of the visualizations saved to the following folder:

/Users/gmt28/Documents/Workspace/Langtech-Humanities_Research_public/language-technology-humanities/Data/Outputs/Anglo_Saxon_Chronicles/


The output of the visualizations saved to the following two files in the directory above:

1. t_sney_document_term_matrix_with_clusters_new.html
2. t_sney_document_term_matrix_new.html

Examine the two visualizations; by mouse hoovering over a point, you will see the corresponding entry; it is sometimes abbreviated.


Use the show_entry function to render a complete entry; for instance to render entry number two, type 'show_entry(2)


If you want to continue with the process, type 'c'
